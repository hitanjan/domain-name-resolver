Whoa there, you might be saying. How do I get rid of my car? That’s where this gift guide—cultivated by you, dear readers—comes in.

In other words: What makes riding the subway or bus not completely unbearable? Which car-rental service is best? Which taxi-hailing app do you rely on? Suggestions welcome below.
To make this gift guide easy to use (and maximally profitable for Gawker Media), please follow these instructions:
1. Begin with the name of the gift, in bold, followed by the price.
2. If there's a photograph, post that below the name and price.
3. Describe the gift and why the sort of person who reads Jalopnik would like it.
4. Indicate where an interested reader can purchase the gift, linking out to an online retailer if appropriate. Which online retailer? That’s up to you. But if you link out to Amazon.com, a nifty little box will appear allowing readers to click a little thingie and buy it right there, which is pretty neat. Even neater, Gawker will get a cut of the purchase price. Do what you will with that information. Get gifting!  Reply Discuss
