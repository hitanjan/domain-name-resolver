        Forge of Empires Helper   January 10, 2015    This site is dedicated to providing you with tools to help you play games in which you have to perform mundane tasks such as collecting and farming resources. When we play games we prefer to do just the fun part! We also like these tools because they greatly free up your time so you can spend it doing what you like to do. If you believe in what we are doing or just like using the software, drop us a dime by clicking on the Donate button. We greatly appreciate it!
