CBS Local Media Week



 in K news

CBS has finally seemed to figure it out- a strategy that has left other media groups scratching their heads and wondering, â€œwhy didnâ€™t we think of this first?â€
CBS-owned television and radio stations across the nation have formed a marriage of sorts, now known as CBS Local Media.  This combination reaches 80 % or more of the market in each of the top five markets in the United States, and that only includes radio and television.  Let us not forget the one medium that is single-handedly threatening the future of radio and television- the internet.  By including all radio and television stationsâ€™ websites in the mix, the reach expands even more and ensures that every platform is working efficiently on its own.
â€œOne of the things I have learned is TV stations do certain things very, very well and other things not so well.  Likewise, radio stations have certain things that they do very well that TV doesnâ€™t do so well.  So itâ€™s trying to bring the best of both together so that we can maximize our local assetsâ€, Anton Guitano, COO of CBS Local Media, states.
CBS Local is now on the verge of signing its first radio-TV political deal.  There is no denying that CBS has finally found it-a method of delivering to a mass audience the way newspapers use to deliver.  The only question is,  what took them so long?
