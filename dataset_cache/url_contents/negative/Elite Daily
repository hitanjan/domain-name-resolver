 overview

 Elite Daily proclaims itself to be the voice of Generation-Y and never disappoints. As the premier online destination for aspiring men and women alike, Elite offers a forum of peer-to-peer interaction in an increasingly digitalized world. The site consistently delivers diverse content with a fresh, relevant voice that appeals to the divergent perspectives represented within our ADD generation.\n\nElite Daily is a medium for people tired of disingenuous content; we have sought to create a space where stimulating, applicable content can reach a like-minded audience. We approach our subject matter much as you do, striking the appropriate balance of inspiration, humor and awareness in a range of categories with special emphasis in world news, travel, sports, culture, entertainment and all things luxury. We explore these topics through a variety of media, including text, video, music and photography.\n\nElite Daily has fused a social community of viral content with unique, authentic voices, appealing to a widespread, international audience by providing a sounding board for this generation to express its innumerable, differing perspectives. With a wide readership and an equally large authorship, Elite is by Gen-Y, for Gen-Y.
