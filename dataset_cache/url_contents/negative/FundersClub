Founders Club at Pawleys Island may have just opened in 2008, but it’s already fast-becoming a tradition among countless golfers.

	With a backdrop like the picturesque setting of Pawleys Island, it’s no wonder this par- 72 golf course has an allure far and wide in all of its 6,910 yards. Founders Club showcases 18 one-of-a-kind holes reinvented by designer Thomas Walker on the former grounds of the Sea Gulf Golf Club.

	Founders Club is known to offer a dramatic but accommodating round of golf – from isolated tee boxes to water features, enhanced by a sprinkling of azaleas and towering live oaks.

	After the 18th hole, wrap up your day on the wrap-around porch at the Founders Club’s Lowcountry-style clubhouse overlooking the 18th green. The clubhouse offers a slew of dining and meeting options.

Utterly terrible

Comments: Worst course imaginable from every aspect.. Greens were horrendous.  7 greens were totally destroyed. Others were slower than putting on shag carpeting. This course should pay golfers to play it rather than charge them. 




Not the best

Comments: Not sure what is going on here. The fairways were dreadful. The greens were a mess. The overall course was not in great shape. I played Grande Dunes the day before  paiding  less for 10 % the value. I will not go back to this course. Finally, you have to cross over various roads about 20 times during the round. Small carts verus big trucks.. you will loose every time. I do have to say the Pro Shop staff were very friendly.

Comments: We were the only two golfers on the course for the entire rainy day and loved every minute of it. The course was in great shape and the greens were some of the best I have ever putted. Besides that, the staff could not have been nicer. Definite replay on teh next trip.

Comments: Fairways were terrible and tees were also awful.  Greens had grass but were very slow.  This is the worst conditioned course I have played in the Myrtle Beach area - and I have played over 40 of the courses.

Comments: Boy, this places gone downhill there is more crabgrass here that I seen on the other for courses that I played. The actual highlight of the round was the chicken salad sandwich in the grill room. This place does not put some money back into the course is good to fall in the bottom or basement courses very soon

More Course Reviews From Around the Beach


Jeffrey - Good layout.. OK course. - 05/05/2015 - 9
Timothy - We have been avoiding the Founder's Club because the last time we played here the greens were pretty much dead, it was like putting on packed mud. I'm happy to say that it has come back and I saw maintenance groups working while we played. That's a good sign.  The greens are now about average for the Myrtle area for this time of year.  The layout here is nice with some challenging holes and some that play very easy. The staff was friendly and talkative which always puts me in a good frame of mind. I would recommend a round here, it's worth the drive from Myrtle Beach. - 03/06/2015 - 9
Mark (Appleton, NY) - For the time of year, the course was in great shape. - 12/17/2014 - 9
