Q.  Do I have to buy CBS ALL ACCESS to watch CBS Programs online?
A.  No.  Recent episodes of most CBS programs are still available for free viewing 
....at CBS.com.  The new All Access service provides a much larger number of episodes 
....and some programs from which we are contractually prohibited from streaming free of charge.

....By hovering your mouse over SHOWS on the top menu at CBS.com and then clicking on the 
....program of your choice, you will be taken to the show page where, in most cases, 
....free episodes will be available to watch.
....You may also click on VIDEOS on the top menu and be taken to a page featuring all 
....episodes for all programs that are currently available for free viewing.








Q.  How can I speak to Audience Services about a CBS program?
A.  You may telephone us at 212-975-3247 between the hours of 10AM and 11:30AM ET
....or 2PM and 3:30PM ET Monday through Friday.






Q.  How can I leave a recorded comment about a CBS program?
A.  If you telephone 212-975-3247 outside the above stated hours, you will hear a recording
....and be given an opportunity to leave a comment.  Please be advised that we
....do not, under any circumstances, return phone calls from viewers.






Q.  How can I write to the performers who appear on my favorite CBS programs?
A.  Click HERE to see a Production Company List for the 2014-2015 Season






Q.  How come the background music is so loud on many tv shows?
A. Occasionally, we have found that viewers who experience an overly loud 
background music playback sometimes have a stereo television and that 
the "front surround" feature is activated.  This would move the rear surround, 
usually music and sound effects, information to the main speakers.  
This can be corrected via your remote control, accessing MENU, and then the 
audio or sound profile.  Set "Front Surround" to "OFF."  We have found that
some cable remotes have crossover signals (for instance their DVR button)
which activate the "Front Surround" on the adjacent television set.








Q.  How can I become a contestant on of one of CBS' reality programs?
A.  You may visit the CBS Casting page at http://www.cbs.com/casting







Q.  How can I be sure and DVR my favorite Sunday Night program in case there is 
an NFL or other sports event runover?
A. The easiest way to be sure you get the entire program or programs you wish to record 
is to manually extend the recording time of the first program you wish to capture.  
Once you select a program to record on your DVR, click Record With Options.  This will 
take you to a screen where you can add additional time to the End of Program time.  
By adding at least an extra hour to the end of program time you will ensure that the 
program you have selected will be recorded in its entirety.








Q.  How may I obtain footage or transcripts from past or current CBS News programs?
A.  You may email the CBS News Archives at footage@cbsnews.com
DVD's of recent 60 MINUTES segments may be available at:  http://www.amazon.com/60minutes







Q.  How may I obtain tickets to LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN?
