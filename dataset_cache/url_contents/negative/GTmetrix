Why is my htaccess rule still producing gtmetrix, yslow expire headers errors?

I have a rule set up in my .htaccess on a WordPress site.  It looks like this:
# manual caching - force use of browser cache 
FileETag MTime Size 
<ifmodule mod_expires.c>   
   <filesmatch "\.(jpg|gif|png|css|js|ico|pdf|swf)$">
      ExpiresActive on
      ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
   </filesmatch>
</ifmodule>

From things I have read, this should take care of all expiry headers.  But when I run a gtmetrix or yslow test, they still give me errors like this:

http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anonymous+Pro%3Aregular%2Citalic%2Cbold%2Cbolditalic%7C&ver=3.5.1

Other pages show similar errors for expiry headers:

http://easyrotator.s3.amazonaws.com/.../FFF_arrow10_export.png (expiration not specified)
http://s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js (expiration not specified)
http://search.twitter.com/search.json?... (15 seconds)
http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js (5 minutes)
https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js (30 minutes)
http://c520866.r66.cf2.rackcdn.com/1/js/easy_rotator.min.js (33.2 minutes)
http://intensedebate.com/js/wordpressTemplateLinkWrapper2.php?... (60 minutes)
http://i.po.st/share/script/post-widget.js (3 hours)
http://www.thisismydomain.org/wp-content/plugins/wp-ui/css/css.php?styles=wpui-light%7Cwpui-blue%7Cwpui-red%7Cwpui-green%7Cwpui-dark%7Cwpui-quark%7Cwpui-alma%7Cwpui-macish%7Cwpui-redmond%7Cwpui-sevin&ver=3.5.1 (20 hours)


I'd assume this is because those particular css's and js's aren't on my domain?  In such a case, is there anything I can do in order to fix this, and increase my speed scores?  Or is there something else I should be doing for better results?  And the one for thisismydomain ... that file extension is css.php, so I'm unsure how I could set an expiry in the htaccess for that.  Thanks for any guidance anybody can offer!
