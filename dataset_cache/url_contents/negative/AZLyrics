Liberty Lyrics — Additional songs Amazing Grace LyricsJohn Newton (1725-1807) Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like
me. I once was lost but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.
T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear. And Grace, my fears
relieved. How precious did that Grace appear The hour I first
believed.  Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come;
'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far and Grace will lead me home.
 The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope secures. He
will my shield and portion be, As long as life endures. Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,And mortal life shall
cease,I shall possess within the veil,A life of joy and peace.Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,And mortal life shall cease;I shall profess, within the vail,A life of joy and peace.The following stanza was written by an an anonymous author, often replacing the sixth stanza, or inserted as the fourth.When we've been there ten thousand years Bright shining as the
sun. We've no less days to sing God's praise Than when we've first
begun. 
 Chorus:Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like
me. I once was lost but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.
