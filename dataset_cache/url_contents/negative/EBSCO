More often than not, when I use this app I get no results whatsoever. It would be a 5 star app if it gave me what I search for as well as it does on the web.                    The help instructions on how can I authenticate my app is kinda hard to follow, so I gave up ay my first try. I logged-in on their "website search database" and saw the mini advertisement / announcement below regarding this app for the android and iphone. And to my surprise, its really fast to authenticate the app! I hope you could make authenticating easier like just asking for the username and password and not by sending these instructions to email. Also I hope you could put the citation styles here!                      I had initial problems but followed the App's instructions and it now works. Here's how: 1. I downloaded the app to my phone 2. I logged into EBSCO on my PC through my college website (or wherever you're subscribed - it might work on phones/tablets but I didn't try that).  3. I clicked on the "New: EBSCOhost iPhone and Android Applications" at the bottom of the "Choose Databases" page (i.e., the first page that opened for me after logging in).  4. I entered my Gmail address in the dialogue box that popped up 5. On my phone, I opened the email and clicked on the authorisation link 6. This opened the EBSCOHost App and I was in. I could search for articles and download pdfs and everything; if they enable browsing under publications and whatnot rather than just searching that would get it 5 stars but I'm happy with it for now.                      I get access to thousands of sources but I have been unable to save or download a single article. I am greeted with the message I put in the title. What is the problem? I am running firmware 2.2 since no higher is available for my phone. Can you fix this??                      Allows you to do nothing other than search. EBSCO is worthless on android. Can't view books in the web browser can't download books with Bluefire and can't view them in their own app. What a tremendous waste.                    Absolutely PERFECT for the University types who cannot sit at a computer desk trawling through hundreds of journals for one or two quotes!

Full Review                                   Really wished it was like the website so Id have access to other important articles and reviews for my research on the go for school. Being a mom, going to college, and holding a fulltime job having an all access app for my research on the go would be awesome. But unfortunately this app doesn't provide that.   Full Review                                   Is the Cochrane Library next in your agenda? Would be lovely to have it as android app 24/7 to a hand!   Full Review                                   There is a all bug in authentication feature because of app unable to exit. After installing, app keeps running. And when u click on authentication link, the app is unable to authenticate.  There must be a way to exit the app accessible by return button.   Full Review                                   I am a librarian,  and I use ebsco constantly.  I am also always on the move,  so this app is a godsend.  I'll work through the bugs.   Full Review                                     Yes, it allows you to search for articles and download them. Without the ability to sign into an account it loses much of its functionality. Would be nice to have this option to make use over different platforms seamless. Also, the UI could use an update to reduce the pixelation.   Full Review                                   It's nice to have this app, but it could be a lot better. There's no advanced search, it doesn't like to work in landscape mode, and on my Xoom at first it didn't work right at all, until I told Android to zoom instead of stretch it, and then put it back to stretch. The good news is that Firefox can deal with the web version just fine.   Full Review                                   To get it authenticated make sure you sent ebsco an email from your institution email address or it won't work. Got email through mine and it works perfectly. Ready to try it!   Full Review                                   need improve on the manual and many of the options seem to be just a pictures manual. It useful when I used and no fc on me.   Full Review                                   I like the interface and everything, but it doesn't have the option for me to log in to my ebsco account for searches I've done on the website.  That would be most convenient. Edit: now all it does is hang when I open the app.   Full Review                                   Wish this worked, but I've tried 3x & can't get it to authenticate. Hopefully tech support will be able to assist, if so I will update my review.   Full Review                                     It did not provide the easy access that the website does, does not provide adequate articles, and no option to log into an already available account.   Full Review                                     Can't view eBooks, can only search, and I can't find anything to link it to my library's account. Removed.   Full Review                                   Only gives access to one search engine. N there's nothing on there for the type of research papers I write. Very disappointed!!!   Full Review                                     No advanced search, and the basic search works less well than the web site.   Full Review                                     Now I dont need to bring my laptop everytime I need to find a journal or article s.   Full Review                                     It hangs whenever I try to open it. Sad, because I rely on it heavily.   Full Review                                     This app is great for the phone. There are a few features that seem to rarely work, like accessing articles from other sources, but otherwise good. I just wish there was a tablet version with a richer interface.   Full Review                                     After reinstalling the app for 5th time, I decided to follow Michael Nicell's instructions and now I have access to all the articles. Great!   Full Review                                     Just get details of books, can't read the actual book.  Maybe due to intentional limitations but impossible to tell.  Needs option to only search books with PDF version available!   Full Review                                   2 different network connections and 2 different browsers later, the authentication key still did not work. If I was lucky, I got a server error message from EBSCO. The utility of this app is limited anyway, since one cannot access EBSCOhost's ebooks, but not even the app itself works on my Nexus 7.   Full Review                                     Good application but needs huge improvement on the UI and in the front end.   Full Review                                     This gives all database at one click   Full Review                                     Only allows viewing of a very limited range of full text articles compared to the web version... Does not allow account login so you can put items into your folder for later viewing on PC. Basically useless because of the above limitations.   Full Review                                     I did not experience the registration logins like what others have been mentioning. I bet the app has limitations like any normal mobile version of desktop applications. My only suggestion is: modernize the ui. It looks old. Try to do something like a Google Now inspired ui or holo. Any modern interface would do.   Full Review                                   Now I can access the databases on the run!   Full Review                                   Nice and simple, and works exactly how you would expect. Your access to data bases and articles is determined by the extent of access of your host library. For example, my access through the National Library of Australia is much wider than the access I get through my membership of the Tasmanian library service.   Full Review                                     Will not let me use my university's access to the service   Full Review                                   It works faster than browser version. The most usefull app for those who does research day and night!   Full Review                                   After spending half an hour trying to figure out how to read an article I have given up. The help section is useless. The screen shots provided in the "how to read an article" look nothing like the actual screen. And just for clarification, the full text of the article I am trying to read IS available on the website.   Full Review                                   Generally ok, doesnt work in landscape mode and personally need the ability to log in (as on the website )to get existing saved articles but is good for quick info   Full Review                                   As a busy student always of the bus or at work this app is a life saver! Sure, its not perfect but its saves me an amazing amount of time.   Full Review                                     Saves searches, view PDFs, share, save specific articles etc.  Activation was easy, I folloeed the two steps from the email. Install the app, click on activation link in email while on device app installed to. Other users must have had older versions because this was quick and simple.   Full Review                                   Is there a way to browse journals instead of searching?   Full Review                                   with the college's credentials. Nice.
