Visiting for the First Time?
Visiting a club is an exciting first step in reaching your goals. There’s no need to feel pressure to participate at your first club meeting – you can simply observe if you wish. And since every club is unique, it’s OK to visit several clubs before you decide to join the right club for you. Have a great first meeting!
