Check out our App integration with Tailwind: The Tailwind app for Hootsuite allows you to create new Pins, schedule drafts for later, or Pin to multiple boards at once—all from within your Hootsuite dashboard!

Hootsuite is a monitoring tool for your brand, right? Then why not create the option to recieve Google alerts in Hootsuite?

Houzz

Houzz is a home improvement site where homeowners and professionals can share ideas by uploading photos and sharing what they like in ideabooks. A few months ago they added the feature to follow favorite members. You can recommend professionals and ask questions about photos to get help with your home improvement project. Would be fantastic if one could manage questions and uploads through hootsuite.

Google+

Google now has released an api for Google Apps users that allows you to programmatically post to the Google+ stream and to read posts from the stream.  
https://developers.google.com/+/domains/
We use Hootsuite to cross-post to Facebook, Wordpress, Twitter and others, but we really need the functionality to be able to post to Google+ as well!
