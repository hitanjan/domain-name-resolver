The same day that Neil deGrasse Tyson's new Cosmos series premiered to rave reviews, talk show host Craig Ferguson announced at SXSW that he'll be producing a science show based on the popular Facebook series I Fucking Love Science. Fuck yeah.
Ferguson will also host the show, which will premiere on the Science Channel. According to Variety, each episode will be an hour-long, and full of live-action, animation, re-enactments, and celebrity guests such as Bill Nye. Here's how Ferguson described the series in his announcement video:

"If you know anything about me, you know I love science. Science has a naughty secret — it's that all things are connected. And this show is going to explore the randomness of science. Think of it as a late night Google search that goes a hundred pages deep until things get weird — and then you just keep going. And there is no better partner for this kind of smart entertainment like Science Channel and Elise."
Elise, of course, is I Fucking Love Science creator and British biology student Elise Andrews. Here's her statement:

I'm
 on board as a consulting producer, and will be contributing to the 
editorial "voice" of the show to ensure it remains true to my vision. 
The show will be 60 minutes and we're hoping it will air in the third 
quarter of this year.In just two short years, we've amassed a following of ten million 
people. Via social media alone, we reach FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE A WEEK. 
With this new venture, we'll be able to reach million of new people and 
show them exactly why science is so damn exciting.To answer the one question I've been asked repeatedly since last 
night: no, I will not be hosting. As much as I appreciate the support, 
I'm just not an "in front of the camera" person. I'll be behind the 
scenes happily producing.
There is absolutely nothing but good news. Two high-profile science shows potentially airing in the same year? That is kind of a renaissance.  Reply Discuss
