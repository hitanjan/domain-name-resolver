FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are scheduled to report their fourth-quarter fiscal year 2015 (4QFY15) earnings results today. The data on earningswhispers.com suggests both the companies are likely to beat the Street on their bottom line, while the data on estimize.com indicates they both have a high probability of beating the consensus sales estimates as well.
FedEx Corporation
FedEx is all set to report its 4QFY15 earnings before the opening bell today. The earnings whispers suggest it would report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.72, beating the Street by three cents per share. Furthermore, the sales estimates on estimize.com hint at a figure of $12.32 billion, ahead of the Street by $21 million this quarter. The Street expects the company to report a 9.34% year-over-year (YoY) growth in EPS, along with a 3.90% YoY growth in sales.
For its last quarter (3QFY15), FedEx reported adjusted EPS of $2.01, beating the consensus by $0.13. Its sales for that quarter were reported to be $11.70 million, missing the Street by $88 million.
Over the previous eight quarters, FedEx has beat the Street on its bottom line five times. However, its sales have missed consensus figures on six of these occasions.
Most of the analysts covering FedEx remain bullish on the stock. 30 analysts currently weigh in on the stock, with 17 of them recommending a Buy, while the rest suggesting a Hold. The 12-month consensus mean price target for the stock is $196.04, reflecting a 7.56% upside over yesterday’s closing price of $182.25. FedEx shares have gained 3.65% over the last three months.
Oracle Corporation
Oracle will report its 4QFY15 earnings results after markets close today. According to earnings whispers, the software maker is expected to report adjusted EPS of $0.90, beating the Street by $0.03. The sales figures on estimize.com project a mean estimate of $11.15 billion, which is ahead of the Street by $225 million. According to consensus estimates, Oracle is likely to report a 5.98% YoY decline in adjusted earnings, along with a 3.53% YoY decrease in sales for the quarter.
For its previous fiscal quarter (3QFY15), Oracle reported adjusted EPS of $0.68, missing the consensus by 0.14%. The company’s sales for that quarter totaled $9.33 billion, missing the Street by 1.42%.
Over the previous two years, Oracle has missed its EPS estimates for five quarters. It has also missed its sales estimates for six of the total eight quarters.
