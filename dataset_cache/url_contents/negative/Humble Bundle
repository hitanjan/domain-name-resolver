I'll spruce things up visually a bit later. Database entries hinting at future bundles are in the second post. I'm open to suggestions for what you'd like to see out of this Humble Megathread.

I'll likely have a shot at that lower tier of Popcap games as I own all of the upper tier.

I'm curious where you are getting "likely" bonus games from.  Arkham Origins DLC in particular seems way out there.











well i asked whether you stood behind your opinions and you said "Always" so i offered up the same bet that i gave to Fire Thief. You think the price of the xbox one will drop to $300 + 2 games by end of year? Let's put a bet on it.

WHERE'S MY CHILDS PLAY DONATION CONFUCIUS!?

I think I had one game on steam before I found the HB. Now I have dozens that I will most likely never play.

This post in the bundle thread contains the evidence. I wouldn't expect it to be very meaty. It's probably skins or something.

One disappointing aspect of the new Store: Humble bumped up their cut.
 

 
Q:What are the splits?
 
A:Even though the Humble Store isn't pay-what-you-want we still are very adamant about supporting developers and charities. After deductions for payment processor fees (typically around 5%) the net revenue is split 3 ways: 75% to developers, 10% to charity and 15% to Humble Bundle to cover costs associated with hosting the content.

 
The Humble widget was a nice way for indie devs to offer a relatively hassle-free way to sell their own game without incurring massive hosting costs while still getting a reported 95% of the sales.  Wonder if someone else will step up.

Right now it's just a page highlighting a few games with the charity hook as well. I wonder if the increased cut is in exchange for the increased visibility. It's possible that sales through the widget are the same. Though maybe not. I've been thinking about this as well.

From 5% cut to an effective 25% cut? Ouch.

Thanks for consolidating the Humble Bundle info.  It'll be nice to have just one thread to check out for the deals.  I wish (EDIT: the Humble Store) gave the option to select the charities you donate to, if not the percentage.  I've been favoring some over others in recent times.
 
The pinball pack looks sick, a must buy.  The popcap is so so.  I'm curious about Zuma's Revenge after hearing Chris Remo talk on Idle Thumbs about getting hooked on it and 100%ing it multiple times (unknowingly!).  It is addictive but disposable I guess.

If you click on Charity a drop down appears that lets you adjust sliders independant of each other. You can do the same thing for developers as well.

Oh sorry, I was referring to the new Humble Store payments.  The devs get 75%, Humble 15%, and all charities split 10%.  This is a bit of a disappointment since I believe the Humble Widgets gave the devs 95% and Humble 5%.  The Store setup is much closer to Steam's %s.

Stinks they only get 75%, but atleast they tell us.
 
Do we know for sure how much Valve takes from steam? or if valve even takes anything for steamkeys sold on other sites?

Who cares about the starving orphans so long as I get cheap games?  Re: Valve's cut.  Developers aren't allowed to say but the 'hypotheticals' that have been thrown out seem to be around the 25-30% range.  That's for games sold through Steam.  No idea if they get a cut from third-party sales.

It's 30% for most, though I assume major players like Activision, Ubi, etc. negotiate lower rates.
 
Steam codes can be generated for free by developers so 3rd party sales don't directly profit Valve (for now).
 
Once Steam becomes a general purpose CDN, things will change. Valve will probably (hopefully?) charge a lower rate to post & serve games ("content") but they won't have to do squat except maintain the actual network. All the posting of games, patches, news, etc. will be the dev's job. Most likely, *everyone* will be able to put whatever crap they want on Steam - there may not even be an actual "curated" Steam store any more. We'll see.

Wish the ETS2 DLC was on sale separately and still waiting for Don't Starve at 75% off.  That said, I approve of these sales and the new Humble Store.
