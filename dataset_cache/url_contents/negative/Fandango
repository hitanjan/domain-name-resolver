Grim Fandango soundtrack CD cover art
Composed by Peter McConnell, Grim Fandango features a timeless soundtrack that brings the game’s world to life. With influences and genres including bebop, big band, jazz, swing, and traditional Mexican music, the soundtrack is a joy to listen to whether playing the game at the time or not.
When the original soundtrack went out of print shortly after its 1998 release, LucasArts gave the Grim Fandango Network permission to make it available for your enjoyment.
Please note that this is not the updated version of the soundtrack that shipped with the remastered edition of Grim Fandango. For the definitive experience, extraction tools may be used on your copy of the remastered edition to export all of the music — including tracks not found on the soundtrack CD — in high quality.
