Excellent course that allows you to transfer theoretical knowledge into practical projects

I would recommend this course for people that at least have studied theoretical base of Javascript and JQuery, because without it it will be hard for you to completely understand some aspects of this course, even tho this course covers some of the basic stuff of jQuery to explain how things work, but it's not enough if you want to be a competent developer, to be such you will have to learn about javascript and JQuery for yourself. W3Schools is a great free resource to get your grip on javascript and jQuery. Here are 2 links that you must learn if you want to get maximum of this course:
http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp

Instructor is great, I really like the way he shows and explains things, I've already passed on of his courses(10 projects in PHP) and I really liked it, it was very useful.








Andrew McG













Fast paced but full full of great ideas and instruction

Be ready to press pause, the pace of this course is fast. You'll also need to do some of your own research to fully understand some of the code being implemented here. That said, this course is a treasure trove of ideas and approaches. It has greatly added to both my knowledge and my library of code :-)








James Parker













Good Course

Tutorial is well organized, clearly explained and all lessons included with advanced techniques.Instructor was positive and the lessons were easy to follow.I sincerely recommend it.Thanks a lot.








Dave













Concepts not explained

In this course you will basically copy everything the teacher is typing, but there is no explanation as to why he is doing it. In other words, concepts are not explained. If you want to copy and paste from the teacher's notes (finished files are available for download), you'll have all the finished projects. However, understanding  the logic behind the steps are another thing. I felt this course fell short of teaching students the "why" behind the "what".








Fiona













Best course I've ever done.

This course does exactly what it says. It teaches you the skills that you needed. It has a good mix of both video and text, with benefits from added reading if you wish to Learn deeper. The course’s ‘no rush’ attitude really fits into my busy life style. The way Instructer teaches makes it very easy to pick up from where you left off a few days ago. I also like the way udemy reminds me if it has been a few days since I last did anything on the course. Overall, I would definitely recommend this course.
