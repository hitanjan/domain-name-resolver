6/15: Your function fails on is_prime(9)
My error message: Your function fails on is_prime(9). It returns True when it should return False.
Why does this fail on 9? I can't figure out why this would return False from the code and I'm having trouble debugging due to the set up of this exercise:
def is_prime(x):
    if x==2:
        return True
    elif x > 2: 
        for n in range(2,x):
            if (x%n) == 0:
                return False
                break
            else:
                return True
    else:
        return False

your range on your elif statement is off. you have to test (2,x-1)










Eliza Miller


That range causes failures for 3




sequester21


besides the range of elif being off, it fails on 9 because the for statement is checking EACH n in that range.  For x=3 to x=8, the function will break for n=2 which is correct. However, the first n that goes into 9 evenly is 3. So the function doesn't know whether it should return True or False.  therefore it returns none and you get an error

I found solution in the web:
    def is_prime(x):
    -----if x == 2 or x == 3:
        ----------return True
    -----elif x % 2 == 0 or x < 2:
        ----------return False
    -----for n in range(3, int(x **.5)+1, 2):
        ----------if x % n == 0:
           ---------------return False
    -----return True

Be descriptive.
      If you're stuck, give as much detail as possible about what you tried and what you're seeing. Include the code you’ve written and the exact error messages that you see, and any other actions that you've tried.
    

Don't just post the code.
      Posts that consist only of code with no other information are not appropriate. Describe what you tried, what did and didn't work, what you understand or have questions about, and what you think might be going on.
    

Format your code for clarity.
      Use Markdown to format your code, mark things italics or bold, and do other formatting that will help your clarity.
