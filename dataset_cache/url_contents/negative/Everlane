            The rise in pared-down duds doesn’t seem to be slowing anytime soon. And, we’re totally okay with that (sorry, prints). But, if there’s one brand that really hits the right notes with its coveted, elevated basics, it’s Everlane. 

The S.F.-based company doesn't just come correct with its styles; we also love the affordable price tags and full-cost breakdowns that accompany each garment. (We even paid a visit to Everlane's Mission HQ to get the full scoop earlier this year.)

So, we couldn't be more excited about the fact that the brand has released its first-ever catalog, filled with shiny, new pieces that are guaranteed to become wardrobe staples. From loafers fit for even the most discerning shoe fanatic to chunky knits you'll want to live in, it's all insanely good. Even the catalog itself is beautiful; you won’t be able to stop thumbing through it. Featuring real, design-savvy women as models — including Caroline Ventura of Brvtvs and Daphne Javitch of TEN Undies — the photos, like the clothes, are a minimalist’s dream come true.
