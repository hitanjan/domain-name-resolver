Pros 
Good ratings from independent labs and in PCMag's own malware cleanup and removal tests. Phishing protection included as a bonus. Free!


Cons 
                         Less effective against rootkits in PCMag's tests. Erroneously identified one PCMag utility as a worm. Bonus phishing protection not very effective.
                     

Bottom Line 
This free antivirus gets good ratings from the independent labs and also scored well in PCMag's own malware removal and blocking tests, though in both tests it had some trouble with rootkits. It's a nice free solution that's worth your consideration.
