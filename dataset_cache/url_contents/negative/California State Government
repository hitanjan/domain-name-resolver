WELCOME TO THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT

Announcements
Summer 2015 Department Office Hours:
 Monday-Friday: 8am-4pm, closed 
 12-1pm. These hours may vary depending on staff availability.

Our Department expects to turn politically interested and concerned students into politically literate college graduates, whatever their career plans or other interests. Specifically, training in Government courses should equip students with analytical skills including (1) the ability to recognize and understand the use of theory, analytic frames and models and their use to interpret and understand political phenomena; (2) the ability to recognize the importance of and to weigh the worth of evidence marshaled to support or oppose an argument; and (3) the ability coherently to systematize and accumulate political information and knowledge and to use this stock of knowledge to better understand the political world.  With these skills you can undertake a variety of careers.
