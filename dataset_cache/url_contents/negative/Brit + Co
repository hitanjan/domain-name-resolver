 It is the final day of the dinner party contest in Derby and the turn of confident triathlete David Morris to serve his offerings. Ondine is not impressed by his small portions, big flavours approach, and is even less satisfied with Jo-Anna's behaviour during the week. The host throws an impromptu work-out class where wrestling promoter Dale Harvey is put through his paces, before the winner of the £1,000 prize is announced. Panellists Lionel Blair, Wayne Sleep, Karen Barber, Louie Spence, Ian Waite, Camilla Dallerup, Lilia Kopylova and Rowland Rivron join hosts Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman for a dance edition of the general knowledge quiz. As usual the players are asked to come up with the least likely correct answers to a series of questions posed to members of the public. Ondine Shardlow hosts the fourth dinner party in Derby, hoping to impress her guests with a flavoursome Greek holiday-inspired menu. However, her carefully planned evening takes a turn for the worse when she manages to insult Dale, and Jo-Anna displays some questionable table manners. PR whizz Beth Dunmore hosts the third night in Derby, and she hopes to impress her guests with her vaguely Middle Eastern menu. However, she has her work cut out when it comes to the fussy David Morris, whose confidence seems to be growing as the week progresses. Beth has a fan in cruise ship connoisseur Jo-Anna, though, while single mum Ondine Shardlow is disappointed with the level of competition and thinks she has the week in the bag.
