The User Experience Dashboards were specifically designed for department heads and non-IT stakeholders to give them an understanding of the frequency, scope and degree to which application users are impacted by performance issues.The User Experience Dashboards use Apdex scores to evaluate the overall performance of SaaS applications while integrating information about each application, location and the number of users. The Dashboards provide performance views along the entire application path – from the end user, through the network to the application hosting source – which is a unique capability specifically relevant for SaaS applications.    “Exponential cloud-based application growth and the needs of large enterprises are driving the need for business critical application performance visibility for non-IT department managers,” said Matt Stevens, CEO and president of AppNeta. “The new User Experience Dashboards for business line managers will give them the information they need to manage around application performance issues as well as better communicate their end users’ experience back to IT.”The worldwide cloud computing market will grow 36% through 2016 and reach a market size of $19.5 billion by 2016 (451 Research, 2013). According to a study by the Aberdeen Group, the most widely deployed SaaS applications include, by adoption rate: CRM (52%), Productivity/Collaboration (50%), Human Resources (29%), Business Intelligence (22%), Financial/Accounting (17%) and ERP (17%). Most of these SaaS applications are deployed and managed by non-IT department heads whose teams depend on these applications to move the business forward.“Given that the IT organization is best equipped to support cloud services, it needs to be a part of the process and must prove itself as a business enabler,” said Shamus McGillicuddy, senior analyst at Enterprise Management Associates. “While aligning IT with business might be effective, EMA research has found that 37% of IT organizations need external consulting to better align themselves with business requirements.
