IntroductionThis is the public wiki for the Heritrix archival crawler project.Heritrix is the Internet Archive's open-source, extensible, web-scale, archival-quality web crawler project.Heritrix (sometimes spelled heretrix, or misspelled or mis-said as heratrix/heritix/ heretix/heratix) is an archaic word for heiress (woman who inherits). Since our crawler seeks to collect and preserve the digital artifacts of our culture for the benefit of future researchers and generations, this name seemed apt.All topical contributions to this wiki (corrections, proposals for new features, new FAQ items, etc.) are welcome! Register using the link near the top-right corner of this page. Browse the wiki

Webmasters!Heritrix is designed to respect the robots.txt exclusion directives and META robots tags, and collect material at a measured, adaptive pace unlikely to disrupt normal website activity.If you notice our crawler behaving poorly – The Internet Archive uses archive.org_bot as User Agent when crawling – please send us email at archive-crawler-agent@lists.sourceforge.net.(If you see a different User-Agent in your logs that still says 'heritrix', it may be someone else using this open-source software. In such a case, even if we can't directly change how your site is crawled, we are happy to help you interpret your logs and identify, contact, or block the source of any troublesome crawling.)DownloadsHeritrix 3.2.0: http://builds.archive.org/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/3.2.0/Heritrix 3.x latest stable development snapshot: https://builds.archive.org/job/Heritrix-3/lastStableBuild/org.archive.heritrix$heritrix/Heritrix 1.14.4: http://sourceforge.net/projects/archive-crawler/files/archive-crawler%20%28heritrix%201.x%29/1.14.4/LicenseHeritrix is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.

This User Manual is generally focused on Heritrix 1.X versions, not fully updated for 1.12/1.14 or the larger changes in 2.0/3.0, but provides a reasonable basis for getting started with Heritrix, especially 1.14.4.There is a FAQ from the 1.x era: http://archive-crawler.sourceforge.net/faq.htmlThe Knowledge Base contains topical articles documenting parts of the crawler and common problems or usage scenarios.For developers, the 1.x-based Heritrix Developer Manual provides a guide to extending and customizing Heritrix code for your own purposes, though of course the source code itself, which is fairly well-commented, is the best guide.For future documentation improvements, we have a Documentation Wishlist.An Introduction to Heritrix provides more detailed information on the structure and design of Heritrix.Some very-old info can still be gleaned from the old wiki (http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://crawler.archive.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?HomePage).Mailing listsHeritrix discussion: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/archive-crawler/Heritrix source code commits: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/archive-crawler-cvsDevelopmentAs of October 2011, immediately following the 3.1.0 release, the Heritrix 3 source repository is hosted at github: https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3Older source code can be found in sourceforge svn: http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=73833Heritrix JIRA bug/feature/issue tracking: http://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER

Hi,
 Thanks you all for good job, but it seems that i foun a bug as  following:
 When a web page has a tag like "<base href='http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/'/>", the url parsed  from .swf file which embed in the web page gets error path, it uses the bad  relative url related from the web page but not from the tag(<base,  href....>).
 This bug can be re-occured by the test url: http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/wszt/list.html.  With  this test url, the crawler reported:404 error for parsed url http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/wszt/xml/albuminfo2.asp,but in fact, the correct url should be: http://www.lndangan.gov.cn/lnsdaj/xml/albuminfo2.asp.
 Please advise, please do not forgget to notify me when the bug  is fixxed if it is a bug.
 Thanks again!

Thanks for your report! FYI, you can enter bugs directly into our 'issues' system, via one of the tabs above, rather than reporting them in a comment. I turned your report into a tracked issue here:
https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1837
There, you can 'Watch' the issue to get updates when we work on or resolve it.
