Digital Billboard Art
The Billboard Art Project is taking over roadside digital LED billboards to turn them into free public art venues for 24 hours or more.
Those in-your-face and colorful canvases that you see as you sit stuck in traffic are turned over to local and international artists for a little break from everyday advertising, presenting larger-than-life art in glowing colors.
Catch a glimpse from your car as you drive by, or hang out for awhile and watch the show with other artists and onlookers.

You won't know what is coming next as different artists explore this medium, with the electronic canvas morphing every 6-10 seconds.
