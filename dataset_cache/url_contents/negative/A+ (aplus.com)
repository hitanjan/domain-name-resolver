Locations1 Locations 12409 Jupiter Rd   Industry Comparison ChartThe information in the table below represents an industry comparison of businesses which are of the same relative size. This is based on BBB's database of businesses located in Dallas and Northeast Texas. Businesses may engage in more than one type of business. The percent of time the business engages in a type of business is not accounted for. There is no known industry standard for the number of complaints a business can expect. The volume of business and number of transactions may have a bearing on the number of complaints received by BBB.Insurance Services   Types of Complaints Handled by BBB BBB handles the following types of complaints between businesses and their customers so long as they are not, or have not been, litigated:  Advertising or Sales Billing or Collection Problems with Products or Services Delivery Guarantee or Warranty  We do not handle workplace disputes, discrimination claims or claims about the quality of health or legal services.    BBB Complaint ProcessYour complaint will be forwarded to the company within two business days. The company will be asked to respond within 14 days, and if a response is not received, a second request will be made. You will be notified of the company's response when we receive it (or notified that we received no response). Complaints are usually closed within 30 business days.  BBB began including the text of consumer complaints and business responses in BBB Business Reviews on 07/01/2013 for complaints filed on 01/01/2013 and thereafter. This includes all complaints that meet our reporting guidelines and that are filed electronically. We also report on the resolution of the complaint, as determined by BBB.   Industry Tips for Insurance Services   What is BBB Advertising Review? BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose	claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising. These claims come to our	attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and	competitor challenges. BBB asks advertisers to prove their claims, change ads	to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive	statements.    What government actions does BBB report on? BBB reports on known government actions that are relevant to the business's marketplace dealings with the public.    About BBB Business Review Content and Services Some Better Business Bureaus offer additional content and services in BBB Business Reviews. The additional content and services are typically regional in nature or, in some cases, a new product or service that is being tested prior to a more general release. Not all enhanced content and services are available at all Better Business Bureaus.  Thank you for your feedback. Help us improve by taking our survey.   BBB Customer Review Rating plus BBB Rating Overview  BBB Customer Reviews Rating represents the customers opinions of the business. The Customer Review Rating is based on the number of positive, neutral and negative customer reviews posted that are calculated to produce a score.     Customer Review Experience Value   Positive Review 5 points per review   Neutral Review 3 points per review   Negative Review 1 point per review    BBB letter grades represent the BBB's opinion of the business. The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business. In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient information about the business despite BBB requests for that information from the business.
