Unless a module specifically calls for this module, developers should check out the AWS SDK for PHP module instead.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module is actually a collection of modules. The first being the main AWS API
module. The sub-modules each deal with a specific Amazon Service.
SERVICE MODULES
In Development and Testing
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
Planned
Simple Storage Service (S3)
Simple Queue Service (SQS)
S3 Admin UI - a higher level S3 module that is easier to administer your S3 account.
SimpleDB (SDB)
Flexible Payments Service (FPS)
Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
I would like to hear from module developers on ideas because this module should make your work much easier. If you would like to collaborate or contribute please contact me via the issue queue or on IRC.
REQUIRED MODULES
REST Client is required for the AWS modules.
DEPENDENT MODULES
Cloud - a GUI for managing EC2 resources
SPONSOR
This project is sponsored by DOCOMO Innovations, Inc.
