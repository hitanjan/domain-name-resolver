SUNNYVALE, Calif. & SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--


 Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and Flurry, Inc. announced today that they 
 have reached a definitive agreement for Yahoo to acquire Flurry.
 

 Yahoo is on a mission to re-imagine users’ daily habits, and mobile is 
 at the center of everything we do. Our agreement to acquire Flurry is a 
 meaningful step for the company and reinforces Yahoo’s commitment to 
 building and supporting useful, inspiring and beautiful mobile 
 applications and monetization solutions. By joining Yahoo, Flurry will 
 have resources to speed up the delivery of platforms that help 
 developers build better apps, reach the right users, and explore new 
 revenue opportunities. Together, the companies can make mobile 
 experiences better through products that are more personalized and more 
 inspiring.
 

 Analytics are critical for all mobile developers to understand and 
 optimize their applications. Yahoo and Flurry are reinvesting in 
 developers and continuing to build great analytics products. The 
 combined scale of the two companies will accelerate revenue growth for 
 thousands of developers and publishers across the mobile ecosystem.
 

 In addition, the joined offerings of Yahoo and Flurry will enable more 
 effective mobile advertising solutions for brands seeking to reach their 
 audiences and gain unique insights across desktop and mobile, and users 
 will benefit from more personalized app experiences.
 

Flurry has been delivering the platform and insights to help 
 developers optimize and personalize their apps since 2008. The Flurry 
 stats speak to their success.



 170,000 developers use Flurry Analytics
 

 Flurry sees app activity from 1.4 billion devices monthly
 

 Flurry sees 5.5 billion app sessions per day
 

 Flurry Analytics is in 7 apps per device on average
 

 8,000 publishers monetize with Flurry
 

 Flurry works with mobile developers in 150 countries
 


As announced in Q2 earnings last week, Yahoo mobile usage is growing 
 rapidly.



 Yahoo’s mobile display and search revenue each grew more than 100% 
 year-over-year
 

 More than half Yahoo’s total monthly audience visits on a mobile 
 device, and in Q2, over 450 million mobile monthly active users came 
 to Yahoo, a 36% increase year-over-year
 

 Time spent on mobile has grown 79% in the last year alone
 

 The average Yahoo user now spends 86% of their time on smartphones in 
 apps
 


 “Yahoo’s growth in mobile traffic comes from great people and great 
 products,” said Scott Burke, SVP Advertising Technology. “Flurry’s 
 success is the result of years of committed investment by a passionate 
 team to create an indispensable platform for mobile developers. We want 
 to harness our collective innovative spirit and bolster the mobile 
 ecosystem by providing developers the analytics and monetization 
 solutions to drive their success.”
 

 “As part of Yahoo, Flurry will continue to serve the application 
 developer community in the way we always have, only better,” said Simon 
 Khalaf, President and CEO, Flurry. “With Yahoo, we will have access to 
 more resources to speed up the delivery of great products that can help 
 app developers build better apps, reach the right users, and explore new 
 revenue opportunities. Over the last six years we have accomplished a 
 lot on our own, but with Yahoo we are in an even better position to 
 achieve our joint goals.”
 

 Following the closing, the Flurry team will remain in their present 
 locations, and Flurry’s vision, mission, and focus will stay the same. 
 Flurry’s products will continue to operate and innovate with Yahoo’s 
 support and investment.
 

 The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
