Overview

Emirates was the second airline to operate the Airbus A380-800 aircraft.
Emirates operates two versions of the A380 with slightly different configurations. This version has fewer Economy Class seats. To verify the correct version of the A380 at the time of booking or at online check-in, the follow rows may be used as reference: Economy begins at row 43 on the main deck; Business Class ends at row 26 on the upper deck.
This aircraft operates with three classes of service. First Class are individual suites with sliding doors. There is also a shower for First Class passengers. Business Class is in a staggered pattern with most seats having direct access to the aisle and a pair of seats down the centre. Economy Class is located entirely on the main deck of the aircraft.
Every seat is equipped with inflight power and individual entertainment.

                                                         Have just returned from Dubai to London. The seat was comfortable with good legroom, the staff were attentive and helpful. This was an economy seat so I didn't expect the earth and after no frills airlines in Europe it was luxury. Emirates are a good airline it's a pity they have Dubai as their hub. If ever an airport was style over substance then this is it. Glitzy marble and all that but  being bussed(!)to the terminal from an A380 is crazy. Less fountains and more information staff would be a start. Hateful place.                                                      






                                                         I loved this flight. It was my second first class experince while my first was the first class aprartment on Ethiad. I am only 14 years old and not many kids get to experince this. Over all this trip was amazing                                                      






                                                         Extra legroom for these seats but colder being beside emergency exit door, easily remedied by wearing socks and using blanket provided. Being beside galley made the fourteen hour flight experience noisy as staff were constantly coming and going (also some passengers). Curtain for galley was only drawn towards end of flight so the light constantly shone out for anyone who preferred it darker to sleep. Had my toes stepped on a couple of times but only by people trying to squeeze by the food trolleys sitting outside the galley at times.                                                      






                                                         If you've any problems with your knees then these pod type seats are hopeless.

I was unable to sleep on a 16 hour flight as I couldn't stretch my right leg to a comfortable position. On top of that, the space between the back of the seat in front ans your table isn't wide enough for a normal person to enter.

If it hadn't been for the amazing standard of service, helpfulness of the staff and the bar, I'd have complained bitterly.                                                      






                                                         Terrible service, actually all the way from Oslo to Bangkok. Tried Emirates (Business) for the first time and extremely dissapointed. Complained to Emirates after a horrible return trip as well. The answer was crap, big time.                                                      






                                                         Great seat with nice view of the wing                                                      






                                                         Look no matter what people carryon about the seats in all emirates planes are great especially considering you are able to afford to fly as many people never do. I loved this seat and it is easy enough to get to the toilet and sleep plus not upset or disturb your fellow travellers. people should generally that fly emirates be happy it isn't Aeroflot or China Southern                                                      






                                                         Just completed a 14 hour journey from Sydney to Dubai.  It was an absolute nightmare.  Although the seat I had is shown as good on the seat plan - and in many respects it was good - what is not highlighted is that this is where the small children and their parents are seated and god help you if the kids scream and cry throughout the journey as happned to us.  Even listening to Jimi Hendrix at full volume didn't block the noise out. Beware!                                                      






                                                         Seat is great due to window position and in conjunction with using the route map and on-board cameras it was my idea of heaven. Agree that economy's front cabin is the best-very quiet. Food was exceptional.                                                      






                                                         While legroom was good, the fact that the aisle widens forward of this row means that people perceive it as a bend and 'cut the corner'. Everyone who passed the seat (including the trolley) bumped me. This is even worse when the screen is deployed (it comes out of the left seat frame and   is a further obstacle). It is such a design flaw that this and 45G should be removed.                                                      






                                                         Great seat, no issues with noise                                                      






                                                         7K suffers from the same problem as 6D and E with noise from the toilets and also from the first class galley which can be VERY noisy as it was on my flight.                                                      






                                                         although the extra legroom was nice the proximity to the exit door made the floor ice cold. I normally don't wear shoes for flights of 3+ hours but it was that cold that even with shoes and blanket it was on the limit. Another drawback is that the exit door was extremely noisy the other parts of the A380 were not loud at all compared to that area. Also it was quiet crowdy as the staff and passengers went to the galley like every 3 minutes. The guy on 52 C almost started a fight because people stumbled across him when he was sleeping. On the flight back I had a normal seat like 76 H which was actually better than the extra legroom seat 52 B although it cost me extra :(                                                      






                                                         Absolute luxury . Emirates lounge in Brisbane is fantastic . Every single staff member that passed me on that plane knew my name . even the bartender down the back. My own mini bar. excellent food and drinks at my leisure. Only fault with this seat , if you like looking out the window you wont be able to as the seat is an aisle seat and your bar and essentials block the window. Other than that , excellence.                                                      






                                                         This has got to be the worst seat on an A380 plane
It is on a restricted isle due to the staff sleeping quarters taking up a large block in the centre seating area and the access door opens opposite the seat.  Staff come and go all through the 14 hour flight opening and closing a sticking door allowing light to enter the main cabin.  Awful!!!                                                      






                                                         For a flag ship airliner the room in economy is in sufficient for an average size person. Not impressed with emirates staff at all. To busy to speak or acknowledge people and the rear seats are to be avoided on a long flight as the staff sleeping quarters are constantly being used and staff wandering around in pj's                                                      






                                                         One should avoid this seat - the gain in extra legroom is minimal and the proximity to the galley makes it awful. Also people going back and forth all the time.                                                      






                                                         Very close to the bar area and kept getting woken up by two particularly loud gentlemen, even with the noise-cancelling headphones. Much prefer row 20, often select 20A which unfortunately was not available on my last trip.                                                      






                                                         yes, this seat is too noisy due the loud
discussions of the stewardesses as well as the continuous opening/close noise of the 
cupboards.                                                      






                                                         This seat is awful.  You are right by the bar and on an evening flight this means you cannot sleep.   Whilst it is a wonderful to have a bar,  its not so great for those people sitting just outside of it with a curtain separating them.  I can't fault Emirates service, it was very good.                                                      






                                                         For a tall person, this seat (I guess all seats except the exit rows) is horrible! Fortunately, the passenger in front of me was tall too, and he agreed not to put down his backrest, so it was acceptable.                                                      






                                                         Flight from Dubai to Bangkok was nice. The seatcomfort in businessclass was ok, but not exceptionel. The length in the sleepingposition is good, also for taller persons as I am with 190cm, but it is to narrow. The meals are ok, the cabinstaff ok, but seemed to be trainees.                                                      






                                                         In comparison with A 340 and Boing 777-300 this seat is the better one. More privacy, includes a side desk + a mini bar, lies completely, though a little bit more narrow then the seat of the Boing 777. Food was OK (not great) service very good. It will be my first choice when travelling businees                                                      






                                                         If you are a couple the seats you need are E&F as they are the only seats next to each other. They are comfortable although a little close to the seats in front,your legs actually tuck in under the seats. Had a really good sleep on the flight out. Everything is close to hand, perhaps a little too close. Entertainment screen is a touch screen, much better than those dreadful 'remotes' on the end of cable. Huge selection of films but nothing I liked or had heard of. Food was ok, on the return breakfast was no better than a charter flight. and service was poor-had to ask for a drink refill 3 times before I got one. I'd heard so much about Emirates and was expecting a great flight experience but was disappointed. I won't rush to fly with them again.                                                      






                                                         The flight I took from AUCKLAND - SYDNEY was the best day of my young life. As I am only still a young child, the first class suite was truly an amazing experience. I am so glad I was one of the few children ever to fly on an Emirates A380 first class suite. I am so so happy and so so grateful to all the flight attendants that occupied your every need. A quick overview:

-Comfort 10/10
-Interior Design 10/10
-Shower 10/10
-Duration 0/10. I wish my flight lasted for a month
-Entertainment 10/10
-Food 10/10

Overall, this was the best flight and day of my life!                                                      






                                                         The business class seats seem narrow and quite enclosed so I often bumped my elbows against the armrest. The seats were private but the bed was rigid and not very comfortable. Service was pleasant.                                                      






                                                         Nicely private window seat, I did find these capsules to be a little narrow and the warm mini-bar and ipad type TV controller were gimmicks, but nice ones. Was served food and drinks sooner than most as was near to the front, which was good as service can be slow for so many business class seats on one flight. The only issue was the distance to the toilets as all business passengers have to use those at the back of the plane, so although you can see from the green light if they are vacant, by the time you get there you may be waiting in a queue. Do ask for the mattresses that are provided to sleep on as they make the seat far more comfortable, even if you don't want to sleep.                                                      






                                                         Standard seat with good window view.  Bassinet row ahead and galley both proved mildly irritating.  Meal service arrangements mean this is the last row to be served and for both main meals only one option remained available.                                                      






                                                         Business seats are substandard for a relatively new plane.  Seats are narrow, tray table small so food is served on a small tray - you end up knocking your food around and if you want a cup of tea you will most likely spill it.  Can't get up without moving your food tray and pushing the tray table back in.  Business class was literally empty with just a handful of passengers so maybe the word is out that its not worth it.  Have flown business on American, British Airways and Royal Jordanian - i wanted to try Emirates and suffice to say  i am very disappointed.  Food on the three other airlines are much much better and the service much more professional and efficient.  Seems Emirates hire hosts and hostesses but don't train them as well.  The lounge is nothing to write home about - located all the way at the end close to the lavatories, it has unwrapped and uncovered food set outside - pastries uncovered may not be as bad as slider sandwiches with meat and piled on top of each other unwrapped and uncovered - not very appetizing.  This was a major disappointment - am going back to my other airlines - older planes sometimes but service in business class and seat comfort is way better.                                                      






                                                         Excellent leg room, however this area of the cabin was very cold.  Large jumper and blankets necessary.  Significant rise in temperature felt on going forward through the next cabin to yhe toilets.                                                      






                                                         The extra leg room is excellent, however at peak toilet use times other passengers were constantly stepping over our legs in order to cross  from one aisle to the other to access a free toilet.                                                      






                                                         Best first class seat. I enjoyed everything in the mini suite. The ICE entertainment, world class dinning, showers, chair bed, amenities, mini bar and more. The seat is so comfortable can really relax. The food is so unbelievably delicious. And of course I had to experience the bar.                                                      






                                                         Emirates is one of my favorite airlines. The entertainment has everything I want. Food was delicious, my second favorite airline meal I've ever had. Cheese Omelette. The seat was so comfortable I can fall asleep easily. The best service ever. The crew are so kind and friendly. I like the uniforms as well. The magazine was great.                                                      






                                                         A, E, F or K-seats are preferred in business class since they have more legroom and storage-space and are more private. E&F seats are especially good if you travel with a companion, A and K seats if you travel alone. The shoe bin under the footrest is usefull but not very easy to reach.                                                      






                                                         The lavs start half way across this seat, so you can see up into the next section. However the toilet door can swing round and hit your feet if you have them extended and the pax lets it go, as children often did. 
Also other pax woud step on your feet to cut to stand by the corner of the lavs. I was lucky mine was a day flight. An evening one would have meant being awoken constantly.                                                      






                                                         good standard seat with basinet one row in front so babies were present but ok. last of economy to board and first off is a bonus .the in seat entertainment is the best i have experienced in economy with the food service excellent on this plane                                                      






                                                         AVOID THIS SEAT!!! This is absolutely one of the worst seats on this airplane. It's right by the galley, and for the over 13 hour flight from Dubai to New York, it was a completely unpleasant experience. Couldn't sleep a wink; as the windows by the galley remained open all through the flight, staging area for meal service was constantly VERY noisy, lots of people congregating in the area, right behind the seats, and on and on.... .
To make matters worse, I had selected my seat prior to the flight with my boarding pass already issued at the airport. Seat was changed to this horrible location at the point of embarkation. Emirates was absolutely unfair!!!                                                      






                                                         Being warned on the seat map that the proximity to the galley may be bothersome before flight, in my eyes it could, be written as a standard seat because I experienced what could be a better experience because there's no one behind me, I didn't get told to put my seat back upright when eating as that happened to me on my two previous connections to Dubai.                                                      






                                                         Emirates business class can not use front/middle bath room. It is for 1st class, although signs state BATHROOM with lights light up in Business class. 
So your better off in middle/rear if you want bathroom.
Seat 6 is not bothersome due to proximity to bathroom because no one in 1st class uses it. They have 2 more in front near their seats. 
honestly thing service on Emirates lacks luster.
Airbus business class seats really are horrible, don't lay flat and poor everything. Side panels flip up with no notice, ICE system really is horrible. I feel sorry for older person like my grandparents to use the ICE system.....                                                      






                                                         The seat are no good for long trips they lack adequate foam and after three hours flying pain and being unconfortable exeist.                                                      






                                                         Very nice seat , beautiful samsung tv screen and perfect bed at night. Super service minded crew of 4 for the 14 seats in first class.  Refreshing shower room with warm floor and space enough for mile high, However E and F seating is better for couples. The coffe bar in front on first class was a water fountain top of the stairs going down on my airplane. you have to walk all the way in other end of business class to get to the bar.                                                      






                                                         The seat was very good, and it is best for children because i got special attention just because i was next to the nearest place whre they make the food                                                      






                                                         In the cubicle that is a business class seat it is very cramped and almost claustrophobic, very difficult to see out the window, impossible to eat ones food, without hitting the right elbow on the cabinet.The seat is narrow and I would hate to have an overnight flight and try to sleep. Once the tray table has been extended, it is almost impossible to leave one's seat without removing all items, ie food etc, from the table onto one of the cabinets. The newer model 380 is slightly better.                                                      






                                                         After asking at the check-in counter they changed my seat to 80J. If you want leg space and be able to get up any time you want, it's a great seat. I was only a little disappointed because I couldn't see anything (there is no window next to you, but an emergency exit).                                                      






                                                         A great seat! Previously I would prefer a window seat, but now I think I like aisle seats more. There was no one sitting next to me so I could lay my feet on the seat next to me and I could get up any time to go to the bathroom or walk for a bit.                                                      






                                                         When we booked we didn't realise these were basinet seats  - the flight was full and when we arrived on board there was already a young couple with a toddler who evidently didn't expect anyone to arrive in the seat.The whole flight the child who must have been close on 2 years, was either screaming, throwing stuff around, kicking me or putting food all over me, plus the mother decided to change her nappy on the floor in front of the seat.  The cabin staff said there was no room to move us nor attempted to help.  On Singapore airlines on the A380 they have room on the top deck for pax without children!                                                      






                                                         My seat was absolutely fab! Reclining seat ,
reasonable leg room, a television with everything you could wish to watch, big windows, and lovely cabin crew! Eventhough you were near the lavatory , you would never know you were there!                                                      






                                                         Business class seats are only half an inch wider than economy seats, not wide enough to sleep. The lounge bar is a joke especially when it only fits about 8 people. I fly business class for the comfort and the Emirates 380 does not deliver. One of the reason I now fly Qatar and Etihad.                                                      






                                                         Great seat! I'm 6ft8 tall and I enjoyed my journey from AKL to DXB very much. There was much legroom due to the missing seat in row 67 just in front of me. Additionally, I had a window to lean onto.                                                      






                                                         Excellent in every respect: huge seat with vibrators (to help reduce DVT?). Quiet. Fully enclosed cabin means privacy. Loads of storage space and wardrobe too. Bed and duvet was good enough for sleep. Full WiFi excellent and it has full internet access too. Cheap at $10/flight. The power shower in the front bathroom - wow - it is brilliant!                                                      






                                                         I read a comment about this seat being noisy etc. I did not find the 'office' under the stairs a distraction and the extra leg space was definitely welcome. If given a choice, I will choose this seat again. In fact, the entire first section of the Economy class can be recommended.                                                      






                                                         When booking, Emirates seat plan for this aircraft shows seats 66J and 66K as a two seat row without seat 66H.  In fact seat 66H is available making this row a standard 3 seat row.                                                      






                                                         It's very noisy in this section of the plane due to the bar and there is continual traffic up and down getting to the bar.   If you don't want to sleep great but I'd choose a different seat if you want some rest.                                                      






                                                         I had this seat on an overnight flight. Noise from galley was very noticeable all throughout the night. There is lighting just by the separating the galley from the cabin which is also disturbing.
On a day flight these would not be an issue but beware overnight.                                                      






                                                         I was in this seat and the entertainment equipment box was not bothering me at all. In fact, it was like the box was not there. The window was not really in a nice place, the seat has 2 windows but 1 window is almost at the seat in front of you, so you cannot really see through. The other window is exacly where your head is, so you have to sit cramped to see through.                                                      






                                                         The armrests do not go up as per most legroom/bassinet seats. Worst, the crew have an office under the stairs and the entrance is next to this row. All flight there is clunking of the handle and bright light coming on when they go in and out...no effort to be quiet....kids wake up. Also proximity to flight deck with its magnetic rope across the entrance is another source of loud clunking during the flight. Also other passengers congregate around this front area for the toilets, to stretch their legs , peek up the stairs and to chat about their day-more noise!

Read user reviews for Emirates Airbus A380-800 (388) V1









                     Have just returned from Dubai to London. The seat was comfortable with good legroom, the staff were attentive and helpful. This was an economy seat so I didn't expect the earth and after no frills airlines in Europe it was luxury. Emirates are a good airline it's a pity they have Dubai as their hub. If ever an airport was style over substance then this is it. Glitzy marble and all that but  being bussed(!)to the terminal from an A380 is crazy. Less fountains and more information staff would be a start. Hateful place.                  






                     I loved this flight. It was my second first class experince while my first was the first class aprartment on Ethiad. I am only 14 years old and not many kids get to experince this. Over all this trip was amazing                  






                     Extra legroom for these seats but colder being beside emergency exit door, easily remedied by wearing socks and using blanket provided. Being beside galley made the fourteen hour flight experience noisy as staff were constantly coming and going (also some passengers). Curtain for galley was only drawn towards end of flight so the light constantly shone out for anyone who preferred it darker to sleep. Had my toes stepped on a couple of times but only by people trying to squeeze by the food trolleys sitting outside the galley at times.                  






                     If you've any problems with your knees then these pod type seats are hopeless.

I was unable to sleep on a 16 hour flight as I couldn't stretch my right leg to a comfortable position. On top of that, the space between the back of the seat in front ans your table isn't wide enough for a normal person to enter.

If it hadn't been for the amazing standard of service, helpfulness of the staff and the bar, I'd have complained bitterly.                  






                     Terrible service, actually all the way from Oslo to Bangkok. Tried Emirates (Business) for the first time and extremely dissapointed. Complained to Emirates after a horrible return trip as well. The answer was crap, big time.                  






                     Great seat with nice view of the wing                  






                     Look no matter what people carryon about the seats in all emirates planes are great especially considering you are able to afford to fly as many people never do. I loved this seat and it is easy enough to get to the toilet and sleep plus not upset or disturb your fellow travellers. people should generally that fly emirates be happy it isn't Aeroflot or China Southern                  






                     Just completed a 14 hour journey from Sydney to Dubai.  It was an absolute nightmare.  Although the seat I had is shown as good on the seat plan - and in many respects it was good - what is not highlighted is that this is where the small children and their parents are seated and god help you if the kids scream and cry throughout the journey as happned to us.  Even listening to Jimi Hendrix at full volume didn't block the noise out. Beware!                  






                     Seat is great due to window position and in conjunction with using the route map and on-board cameras it was my idea of heaven. Agree that economy's front cabin is the best-very quiet. Food was exceptional.                  






                     While legroom was good, the fact that the aisle widens forward of this row means that people perceive it as a bend and 'cut the corner'. Everyone who passed the seat (including the trolley) bumped me. This is even worse when the screen is deployed (it comes out of the left seat frame and   is a further obstacle). It is such a design flaw that this and 45G should be removed.                  






                     Great seat, no issues with noise                  






                     7K suffers from the same problem as 6D and E with noise from the toilets and also from the first class galley which can be VERY noisy as it was on my flight.                  






                     although the extra legroom was nice the proximity to the exit door made the floor ice cold. I normally don't wear shoes for flights of 3+ hours but it was that cold that even with shoes and blanket it was on the limit. Another drawback is that the exit door was extremely noisy the other parts of the A380 were not loud at all compared to that area. Also it was quiet crowdy as the staff and passengers went to the galley like every 3 minutes. The guy on 52 C almost started a fight because people stumbled across him when he was sleeping. On the flight back I had a normal seat like 76 H which was actually better than the extra legroom seat 52 B although it cost me extra :(                  






                     Absolute luxury . Emirates lounge in Brisbane is fantastic . Every single staff member that passed me on that plane knew my name . even the bartender down the back. My own mini bar. excellent food and drinks at my leisure. Only fault with this seat , if you like looking out the window you wont be able to as the seat is an aisle seat and your bar and essentials block the window. Other than that , excellence.                  






                     This has got to be the worst seat on an A380 plane
It is on a restricted isle due to the staff sleeping quarters taking up a large block in the centre seating area and the access door opens opposite the seat.  Staff come and go all through the 14 hour flight opening and closing a sticking door allowing light to enter the main cabin.  Awful!!!                  






                     For a flag ship airliner the room in economy is in sufficient for an average size person. Not impressed with emirates staff at all. To busy to speak or acknowledge people and the rear seats are to be avoided on a long flight as the staff sleeping quarters are constantly being used and staff wandering around in pj's                  






                     One should avoid this seat - the gain in extra legroom is minimal and the proximity to the galley makes it awful. Also people going back and forth all the time.                  






                     Very close to the bar area and kept getting woken up by two particularly loud gentlemen, even with the noise-cancelling headphones. Much prefer row 20, often select 20A which unfortunately was not available on my last trip.                  






                     yes, this seat is too noisy due the loud
discussions of the stewardesses as well as the continuous opening/close noise of the 
cupboards.                  






                     This seat is awful.  You are right by the bar and on an evening flight this means you cannot sleep.   Whilst it is a wonderful to have a bar,  its not so great for those people sitting just outside of it with a curtain separating them.  I can't fault Emirates service, it was very good.                  






                     For a tall person, this seat (I guess all seats except the exit rows) is horrible! Fortunately, the passenger in front of me was tall too, and he agreed not to put down his backrest, so it was acceptable.                  






                     Flight from Dubai to Bangkok was nice. The seatcomfort in businessclass was ok, but not exceptionel. The length in the sleepingposition is good, also for taller persons as I am with 190cm, but it is to narrow. The meals are ok, the cabinstaff ok, but seemed to be trainees.                  






                     In comparison with A 340 and Boing 777-300 this seat is the better one. More privacy, includes a side desk + a mini bar, lies completely, though a little bit more narrow then the seat of the Boing 777. Food was OK (not great) service very good. It will be my first choice when travelling businees                  






                     If you are a couple the seats you need are E&F as they are the only seats next to each other. They are comfortable although a little close to the seats in front,your legs actually tuck in under the seats. Had a really good sleep on the flight out. Everything is close to hand, perhaps a little too close. Entertainment screen is a touch screen, much better than those dreadful 'remotes' on the end of cable. Huge selection of films but nothing I liked or had heard of. Food was ok, on the return breakfast was no better than a charter flight. and service was poor-had to ask for a drink refill 3 times before I got one. I'd heard so much about Emirates and was expecting a great flight experience but was disappointed. I won't rush to fly with them again.                  






                     The flight I took from AUCKLAND - SYDNEY was the best day of my young life. As I am only still a young child, the first class suite was truly an amazing experience. I am so glad I was one of the few children ever to fly on an Emirates A380 first class suite. I am so so happy and so so grateful to all the flight attendants that occupied your every need. A quick overview:

-Comfort 10/10
-Interior Design 10/10
-Shower 10/10
-Duration 0/10. I wish my flight lasted for a month
-Entertainment 10/10
-Food 10/10

Overall, this was the best flight and day of my life!                  






                     The business class seats seem narrow and quite enclosed so I often bumped my elbows against the armrest. The seats were private but the bed was rigid and not very comfortable. Service was pleasant.                  






                     Nicely private window seat, I did find these capsules to be a little narrow and the warm mini-bar and ipad type TV controller were gimmicks, but nice ones. Was served food and drinks sooner than most as was near to the front, which was good as service can be slow for so many business class seats on one flight. The only issue was the distance to the toilets as all business passengers have to use those at the back of the plane, so although you can see from the green light if they are vacant, by the time you get there you may be waiting in a queue. Do ask for the mattresses that are provided to sleep on as they make the seat far more comfortable, even if you don't want to sleep.                  






                     Standard seat with good window view.  Bassinet row ahead and galley both proved mildly irritating.  Meal service arrangements mean this is the last row to be served and for both main meals only one option remained available.                  






                     Business seats are substandard for a relatively new plane.  Seats are narrow, tray table small so food is served on a small tray - you end up knocking your food around and if you want a cup of tea you will most likely spill it.  Can't get up without moving your food tray and pushing the tray table back in.  Business class was literally empty with just a handful of passengers so maybe the word is out that its not worth it.  Have flown business on American, British Airways and Royal Jordanian - i wanted to try Emirates and suffice to say  i am very disappointed.  Food on the three other airlines are much much better and the service much more professional and efficient.  Seems Emirates hire hosts and hostesses but don't train them as well.  The lounge is nothing to write home about - located all the way at the end close to the lavatories, it has unwrapped and uncovered food set outside - pastries uncovered may not be as bad as slider sandwiches with meat and piled on top of each other unwrapped and uncovered - not very appetizing.  This was a major disappointment - am going back to my other airlines - older planes sometimes but service in business class and seat comfort is way better.                  






                     Excellent leg room, however this area of the cabin was very cold.  Large jumper and blankets necessary.  Significant rise in temperature felt on going forward through the next cabin to yhe toilets.                  






                     The extra leg room is excellent, however at peak toilet use times other passengers were constantly stepping over our legs in order to cross  from one aisle to the other to access a free toilet.                  






                     Best first class seat. I enjoyed everything in the mini suite. The ICE entertainment, world class dinning, showers, chair bed, amenities, mini bar and more. The seat is so comfortable can really relax. The food is so unbelievably delicious. And of course I had to experience the bar.                  






                     Emirates is one of my favorite airlines. The entertainment has everything I want. Food was delicious, my second favorite airline meal I've ever had. Cheese Omelette. The seat was so comfortable I can fall asleep easily. The best service ever. The crew are so kind and friendly. I like the uniforms as well. The magazine was great.                  






                     A, E, F or K-seats are preferred in business class since they have more legroom and storage-space and are more private. E&F seats are especially good if you travel with a companion, A and K seats if you travel alone. The shoe bin under the footrest is usefull but not very easy to reach.                  






                     The lavs start half way across this seat, so you can see up into the next section. However the toilet door can swing round and hit your feet if you have them extended and the pax lets it go, as children often did. 
Also other pax woud step on your feet to cut to stand by the corner of the lavs. I was lucky mine was a day flight. An evening one would have meant being awoken constantly.                  






                     good standard seat with basinet one row in front so babies were present but ok. last of economy to board and first off is a bonus .the in seat entertainment is the best i have experienced in economy with the food service excellent on this plane                  






                     AVOID THIS SEAT!!! This is absolutely one of the worst seats on this airplane. It's right by the galley, and for the over 13 hour flight from Dubai to New York, it was a completely unpleasant experience. Couldn't sleep a wink; as the windows by the galley remained open all through the flight, staging area for meal service was constantly VERY noisy, lots of people congregating in the area, right behind the seats, and on and on.... .
To make matters worse, I had selected my seat prior to the flight with my boarding pass already issued at the airport. Seat was changed to this horrible location at the point of embarkation. Emirates was absolutely unfair!!!                  






                     Being warned on the seat map that the proximity to the galley may be bothersome before flight, in my eyes it could, be written as a standard seat because I experienced what could be a better experience because there's no one behind me, I didn't get told to put my seat back upright when eating as that happened to me on my two previous connections to Dubai.                  






                     Emirates business class can not use front/middle bath room. It is for 1st class, although signs state BATHROOM with lights light up in Business class. 
So your better off in middle/rear if you want bathroom.
Seat 6 is not bothersome due to proximity to bathroom because no one in 1st class uses it. They have 2 more in front near their seats. 
honestly thing service on Emirates lacks luster.
Airbus business class seats really are horrible, don't lay flat and poor everything. Side panels flip up with no notice, ICE system really is horrible. I feel sorry for older person like my grandparents to use the ICE system.....                  






                     The seat are no good for long trips they lack adequate foam and after three hours flying pain and being unconfortable exeist.                  






                     Very nice seat , beautiful samsung tv screen and perfect bed at night. Super service minded crew of 4 for the 14 seats in first class.  Refreshing shower room with warm floor and space enough for mile high, However E and F seating is better for couples. The coffe bar in front on first class was a water fountain top of the stairs going down on my airplane. you have to walk all the way in other end of business class to get to the bar.                  






                     The seat was very good, and it is best for children because i got special attention just because i was next to the nearest place whre they make the food                  






                     In the cubicle that is a business class seat it is very cramped and almost claustrophobic, very difficult to see out the window, impossible to eat ones food, without hitting the right elbow on the cabinet.The seat is narrow and I would hate to have an overnight flight and try to sleep. Once the tray table has been extended, it is almost impossible to leave one's seat without removing all items, ie food etc, from the table onto one of the cabinets. The newer model 380 is slightly better.                  






                     After asking at the check-in counter they changed my seat to 80J. If you want leg space and be able to get up any time you want, it's a great seat. I was only a little disappointed because I couldn't see anything (there is no window next to you, but an emergency exit).                  






                     A great seat! Previously I would prefer a window seat, but now I think I like aisle seats more. There was no one sitting next to me so I could lay my feet on the seat next to me and I could get up any time to go to the bathroom or walk for a bit.                  






                     When we booked we didn't realise these were basinet seats  - the flight was full and when we arrived on board there was already a young couple with a toddler who evidently didn't expect anyone to arrive in the seat.The whole flight the child who must have been close on 2 years, was either screaming, throwing stuff around, kicking me or putting food all over me, plus the mother decided to change her nappy on the floor in front of the seat.  The cabin staff said there was no room to move us nor attempted to help.  On Singapore airlines on the A380 they have room on the top deck for pax without children!                  






                     My seat was absolutely fab! Reclining seat ,
reasonable leg room, a television with everything you could wish to watch, big windows, and lovely cabin crew! Eventhough you were near the lavatory , you would never know you were there!                  






                     Business class seats are only half an inch wider than economy seats, not wide enough to sleep. The lounge bar is a joke especially when it only fits about 8 people. I fly business class for the comfort and the Emirates 380 does not deliver. One of the reason I now fly Qatar and Etihad.                  






                     Great seat! I'm 6ft8 tall and I enjoyed my journey from AKL to DXB very much. There was much legroom due to the missing seat in row 67 just in front of me. Additionally, I had a window to lean onto.                  






                     Excellent in every respect: huge seat with vibrators (to help reduce DVT?). Quiet. Fully enclosed cabin means privacy. Loads of storage space and wardrobe too. Bed and duvet was good enough for sleep. Full WiFi excellent and it has full internet access too. Cheap at $10/flight. The power shower in the front bathroom - wow - it is brilliant!                  






                     I read a comment about this seat being noisy etc. I did not find the 'office' under the stairs a distraction and the extra leg space was definitely welcome. If given a choice, I will choose this seat again. In fact, the entire first section of the Economy class can be recommended.                  






                     When booking, Emirates seat plan for this aircraft shows seats 66J and 66K as a two seat row without seat 66H.  In fact seat 66H is available making this row a standard 3 seat row.                  






                     It's very noisy in this section of the plane due to the bar and there is continual traffic up and down getting to the bar.   If you don't want to sleep great but I'd choose a different seat if you want some rest.                  






                     I had this seat on an overnight flight. Noise from galley was very noticeable all throughout the night. There is lighting just by the separating the galley from the cabin which is also disturbing.
On a day flight these would not be an issue but beware overnight.                  






                     I was in this seat and the entertainment equipment box was not bothering me at all. In fact, it was like the box was not there. The window was not really in a nice place, the seat has 2 windows but 1 window is almost at the seat in front of you, so you cannot really see through. The other window is exacly where your head is, so you have to sit cramped to see through.                  






                     The armrests do not go up as per most legroom/bassinet seats. Worst, the crew have an office under the stairs and the entrance is next to this row. All flight there is clunking of the handle and bright light coming on when they go in and out...no effort to be quiet....kids wake up. Also proximity to flight deck with its magnetic rope across the entrance is another source of loud clunking during the flight. Also other passengers congregate around this front area for the toilets, to stretch their legs , peek up the stairs and to chat about their day-more noise!
