                  While perhaps not as widely distributed as Grant's, Thomson's 
                  are still the most common gazelles in East Africa. Though 
                  their numbers have diminished in some areas, in others they 
                  have persisted on ranches and farmlands long after other 
                  species have disappeared.

 
                  Physical Characteristics 
                  The graceful "tommie" is noticeably smaller than the 
                Grant's gazelle, which it resembles in shape and color. It is 
                also distinguished from a Grant's by the dark side stripe that 
                runs from the shoulder to the flank and the white patch on the 
                rump. The tommy is a dark fawn or cinnamon color on the topside 
                and white on the underside. The black tail seems to be 
                constantly in motion.
                The males are larger than the females and have strongly 
                ridged, almost parallel horns that curve backwards, with the 
                tips curving forward. Female tommies have short, smooth, 
                pencil-slim horns, or none at all. The face is accented by a 
                black stripe running down from the eye, a dark marking on the 
                nose and a light patch on the forehead.


Habitat
                  Although more reliant on water than Grant's gazelle, the tommy 
                  has adapted to the open plains and grasslands of southern 
                  Kenya and northern Tanzania.


Behavior
                During migration, as tommies spread out over the 
                plains in the wake of zebra and wildebeest herds, the strongest 
                males set up territories. They use an exaggerated display 
                posture when urinating or defecating on dung piles. To mark the 
                boundaries the males deposit a small amount of secretion from 
                their scent glands (located beneath the eyes) onto a blade of 
                grass, leaving these markers daily about every 20 feet. As the 
                herd migrates, new territories are established.
                The females along with their immature offspring form groups 
                of five to 50 that wander through male territories. The groups 
                change members and numbers from hour to hour, so no obvious 
                patterns of hierarchy or leadership emerge. Nonterritorial males 
                gather together in small groups along the outskirts of the 
                larger herd, generally avoiding other male territories unless 
                one of the group attempts to take one over.
                In the early morning and again in the evening, the herd, 
                which may have spread out during the day, comes together. This 
                is playtime for the younger gazelles, when they engage in 
                stotting and pronking (bouncing along on stiff legs) and sprint 
                around the perimeter of the herd.
                The relatively silent tommies rely on visual awareness of one 
                another to stay in contact. Their distinctive coloring may 
                help-they can contract the skin so the black side stripe becomes 
                more obvious. They also stamp their front feet to signal when 
                they are disturbed.


Diet
                  Tommies congregate not only with Grant's gazelle but with 
                  larger ungulates such as wildebeest and zebra-and even cattle, 
                  which trample and graze on tall grass, making it easier for 
                  the tommy to feed on short grass. Although grasses make up 
                  about 90 percent of the tommy's diet in dry season, it also 
                  eats seeds and browses on shrubs. When the tiny new green 
                  shoots of grass begin to grow in areas that have been burned, 
                  tommies often gather in large numbers to feed.


Caring for the Young
                  Tommies breed twice a year. Although births occur 
                throughout the year, they peak right after rainy seasons. After 
                giving birth the mother hides the newborn in the grass, 
                returning several times a day to nurse it. With their tawny 
                coloring and ability to remain motionless for long periods, the 
                young are surprisingly invisible when hidden in open country.
                
                Nevertheless, predation on the young is heavy, and many 
                predators feed on nothing else during the calving peaks.
 

Predators
                  Cheetahs, lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas prey on 
                  young and adults alike, with adult tommy males three times 
                  more susceptible than females. The young are also taken by 
                  serval cats, jackals, baboons, eagles and pythons.
 

Did you know?

The Thomson gazelle is exceptionally alert to sounds and 
                  movements, and its fine senses of hearing, sight and smell 
                  balance its vulnerability on the open plains. 
Males vigorously defend their territories. If challenged, 
                  the defending male and his rival clash horns, with the winner 
                  claiming the territory.
