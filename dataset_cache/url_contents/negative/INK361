INK361 Launches Picattoo and FastBook in the U.S. to Bring Printable Instagram Tattoos and Photo Books to Local Photo Fans 

Picattoo Is a First-of-Its-Kind Temporary Tattoo Made From Instagram Photos; FastBook Makes Creating and Printing Photo Albums From Instagram Pictures Easy



CHICAGO, IL--(Marketwired - Jan 21, 2015) -  INK361 (http://ink361.com), the international company that develops products for people that love photos and photography, today announced two cool new products for U.S. Instagram lovers: Picattoo (http://picattoo.com), a first-of-its-kind temporary tattoo grafted from Instagram photos, and FastBook (http://www.fastbook.co), a high quality photo album of Instagram photos created in seconds. Co-founded by Carel Van Apeldoorn in 2011, INK361.com is a popular Instagram browser that allows users to customize their experience from a "Deck Viewer" to monitor what is happening on Instagram, view, comment and like photos, create albums, and get analytics and prints of their favorite pictures. The two new products, available worldwide today, are INK361's latest offering in an effort to expand into the U.S. and European marketplace with a variety of photo printing solutions. 
Picattoos are an innovative integration of photography, social media and body art, and are a creative way to showcase adorable pets, kids, travel snaps and typography or graphic artwork. The temporary tattoos also make great gifts and party favors to add fun and flair to any event for attendees of all ages. Getting your hands on a Picattoo is very simple: just log into Instagram through picattoo.com, select 12 images to print and place an order. That's it. Picattoos are printed on high quality tattoo transfer paper, will last for up to a week and come in a pack of 12 ready-to-use tattoos upon delivery. Picattoo ships all over the world for just $14.99.
Fastbook is the second creative photo product from the INK361 team. Created from premium quality photo paper with a choice of matte or glossy finish and black or white cover, FastBooks are a great way to keep memorable moments close-by in a book that fits conveniently in your pocket. Photo books are wildly popular and also make great gifts for loved ones, and can even be used as home décor as a coffee table or bathroom book. Simply log in to your social media account through fastbook.co, select the photos you would like to include in the book and you're done, in seconds. Fastbooks come in 24-page and 48-page books starting at $14.95. 
"Social media photography has exploded with mobile photographers snapping and sharing all of life's most photogenic moments as they happen; however, there's still a huge market for tangible photographs," said Van Apeldoorn, CEO of INK361. "Picattoo and FastBook are creative ways to let the moments live on in real time. Plus, they're so fun to create, give, wear and share." 
As an early adopter of Instagram, Van Apeldoorn developed INK361 as a place to view, discover, organize and print Instagram photos. Built by a small team of photography and technology enthusiasts who worked remotely across North America, Europe and Asia, INK361 is now a global printing solution for photography fans around the world and receives 450 million monthly pageviews, 30 million visits and about 20 million monthly active users abroad. Expansion into the U.S. market will create more opportunities for social ecommerce and partnerships. 
"We are passionate about entrepreneurship, photography and the internet, but from day one, we wanted to focus on printing and the retail market because there's something timeless and endlessly creative about print photograph," said Van Apeldoorn. "We're thrilled at the opportunity to extend our products to the U.S. market where mobile photography innovation is blossoming."
