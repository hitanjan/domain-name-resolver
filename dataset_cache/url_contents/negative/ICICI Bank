ICICI's insurance business drives higher returns on equity.

Morningstar's Take | 
by 







Investment Thesis
ICICI Bank offers banking and insurance services to a wide spectrum of clients. It has banking operations in India, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with India being its largest profit source, contributing nearly 85% of the company’s consolidated accounting profits. Its general and life insurance businesses together, however, have contributed only 10% to its fiscal 2015 earnings. Despite generating over 20% revenue, insurance has suffered from low profitability because of large upfront expenses, which made it a long-gestation business in the past. The life insurance business began generating profits only in fiscal 2011, and its general insurance business reached break-even in 2012, for the first time since both began operations in 2000. However, in fiscal 2012 and 2013, due to regulatory changes, in liability recognition of third-party motor pooling insurance cover, the general insurance arm had to account for one-time expenses to the tune of INR 6.85 billion and INR 1 billion, respectively. As a result of this exceptional charge, the general insurance arm of ICICI only generated its first accounting profit in fiscal 2013. With regulatory changes behind us, the insurance business has begun reporting profits and pushed return on equity above our threshold 12% cost of equity over the past three years. We are therefore upgrading ICICI’s economic moat rating to narrow from none.Keeping the insurance and international operations aside, the Indian bank on a standalone basis, began generating ROEs above 14% beginning fiscal 2013. Between 2008 and 2012, the bank suffered low profitability during the aftermath from the global financial crisis and its badly hurt loan quality on the unsecured personal loans and credit card debt front. While the bank is operationally strong with a low cost-to-income ratio on a standalone basis of under 40% compared to 50%-55% experienced by peers, we believe there is scope for improvement in the bank’s underwriting standards as credit costs are higher at 1.3% of net loans compared to 1% for most other Indian banks. As such, we believe the bank can work on several aspects to bump profitability further upwards.


Risk
With most of the regulatory headwinds behind us, especially those on the insurance side, we are moving the uncertainty rating for ICICI Bank to high from very high. The high uncertainty rating is in line with our global banking and financial coverage, as earnings and growth at these firms tend to be closely linked to the economies they serve.We believe the bank’s success and risk are linked to economic growth momentum in India. While we think our bull and bear scenarios capture loan losses rather appropriately. Deterioration materially beyond our expectations would prompt us to revise our estimates and possibly modify ICICI Bank’s fair value estimate. Further, a global economic downturn could result in a more drastic drop in confidence in India and significant outflows of foreign capital, which could cause strains in domestic liquidity and hinder growth. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rate directly affect our ADR fair value estimate. Hence, investors without currency hedges could see a drop in ADR price that does not stem from fundamental changes in the underlying business.


Company Profile
With over $130 billion in assets and over 4,050 branches, ICICI bank is India's largest non-government-owned financial institution. Over the years, it has shifted from a bank offering only project finance to a consumer-oriented financial services provider. Today, it provides an array of banking and insurance services to a wide spectrum of clients in both urban and rural areas. The bank's insurance business contributes over 20% to consolidated net revenue and 10% to pretax profits.

Bulls Say

With more than 4,050 existing branches and more expected to open soon, ICICI has a very broad distribution network, which allows it to offer its diverse products to a wide spectrum of customers.
The bank has significant room for profitable growth by serving India's unbanked population, its rising middle class, and the millions of Indians living in the U.K. and Canada.
As one of the largest private sector insurers in India, ICICI's insurance business has considerable potential, in our opinion.


Bears Say

Devaluation of the Indian rupee directly affects our fair value estimate in U.S. dollars. For example, a 10% decline in the exchange rate entails a 10% fall in the ADR price without any deterioration in the bank's fundamentals.
As the insurance business gains prominence in the company’s consolidated performance, deficient disclosures on the detailed performance drivers of this segment prevent investors from adequately monitoring and detecting problems in advance.
Regulatory changes in the insurance sector continue to cast a shadow on the sustainability of returns at ICICI Bank.
