CHANGING YOUR SQUAD



SUBSTITUTIONS

 Unlimited subs.

 75 subs.


After Match 56 and before Qualifier 1:
 Unlimited subs.


Qualifier 1 to Final:
 10 subs.


FREE UNCAPPED SUBS


Every match, you can bring in one uncapped player into the squad without it counting as a substitution. So, picking an uncapped player for each match is a great strategy.


POWER PLAYER


You can change your Power Player as many times as you want. So remember to change it for every match.


LOCK IN


Teams are locked when the first ball of a match is bowled.Changes made after the first ball of a match is bowled will not affect points earned in that match. So if you drop a player after the first ball of the match is bowled, he’ll still earn points for you in that match.


For the Daily Challenge, you can make unlimited substitutions till the first ball of the first match of the day is bowled. You cannot make any changes to your squad for that day after the first ball of the day is bowled.
