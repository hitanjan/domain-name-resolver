There is a 30 day unlimited free trial and it is free if you have no more than one active client. If you have more clients, it will require a subscription that also brings things like automatic bank import. Pricing starts at $9.95/month (comparable to QuickBooks Online). If you have more questions, please email support@freshbooks.com. -RS                                   I run a photography business with over 250 clients and about 600 shoots a year.

Thanks for the feedback and reporting the issue with the S6 and the camera screen. The bug has been reported to the developers and they will hopefully get a fix out soon.

Thanx for the reply team ðŸ˜Š Il start using ur app and give it its well deserved 5 stars once the problem is sorted.   Full Review          Hi Haydn,

Thanks for letting us know about this issue. The app should auto focus but it does not currently support tap to focus. I have notified the developers to investigate this issue further and hopefully it's something they can resolve shortly. Currently, I would recommend taking the photo outside the app and selecting it from the gallery. -RS                                   Out of all the programs I use to run my business, this has been the most important one by far.

Sorry to hear that you are having trouble with your new Samsung S6. We are aiming to get one in the office soon to test this out. I have gone ahead and sent a bug fix to the team and they will hopefully get it fixed soon for you. Sincerely sorry that you are experiencing this problem. -Ramin                                   Thereafter minimum $30 per month   Full Review          Hi Peter,

FreshBooks offers a free account after the 30 day trial if you have no more than 1 active client. The cheapest package starts at 19.95 a month and if you email support@freshbooks.com we might be able to get a cheaper package for you that works for your wallet.

Full Review          Hi Dave,

Thanks for letting us know about this issue. I have created a bug ticket for it and hopefully it will get resolved soon. If you have any other questions about the bug, you can email support@freshbooks.com. Sincerely, Ramin                                   Cannot login using Google credentials. The workaround is silly and unsafe (no 2 factor). No tablet support at all (I use a tablet with keyboard). Going to try NeadMoney now.   Full Review          Hi there Teun,

Sorry to hear that you didn't have a great first experience with the app. I hear you on better tablet support and enabling 2FA throughout FreshBooks (desktop and mobile apps). I have passed your feedback to the product team so they know what you want to see. Using Chrome on the tablet might be your best bet right now vs. Nead Money.                                   Excellent  app and site. I do all my accounting for my business in this site. I'd recommend it to every body.   Full Review                                     FEBA Security Services loved the functionalities and ease of use working with the software. I look forward to a long and future relationship with Freshbooks.   Full Review                                     I have called them personally, and literally, every time, they answer on the 2nd ring. Super polite, very helpful, and they don't talk down to you like a lot of support do. I won't mention "Comcast". I love their product, and, after using it for a few months, have a few minor suggestions for more fluidity in my workflow. (Hopefully in others too). Regardless, I'm behind " Fresh books" 100%. Try their product. You'll love it.   Full Review                                     The only thing missing is a quick, one tap way to start a timer (widget?). As it stands now, I have to launch the app and tap through several things to start timing. Otherwise, this app is fantastic!   Full Review          Hi there Tom!

Thanks for the great feedback and I hear you on a quicker way to start a timer. We could potentially create a timer widget for the home screen to make it easier to start tracking time without digging through the app. I have sent your feature request to the product team for you! Cheers, Ramin                                   Expenses capture doesn't work. Camera always freezes. This is a very important part for us as makes it easier to capture expenses on the fly. Also ability to do time tracking missing.   Full Review          Hi there Jinmi,

Sorry to hear that you are having trouble with the camera. Can you contact support@freshbooks.com with more info and we will look into it further? We have other Note3 customers who haven't run into this issue. We do time tracking and its the icon on the bottom left of the home screen with the clock icon. Sincerely, Ramin                                   One BIG issue, it NEEDS PIN security implemented. Syncing time has become horrid too. -1 more star.   Full Review          Hi Andrew,

Thanks for the feedback, relayed it over to the product team. If you dont already, put a pin/passcode on your device because it will also encrypt the data making it harder for evil people to get your data if they have your device. If you have any other questions or suggestions, please contact our support team. Cheers, Ramin                                   Made my life easier   Full Review                                     I have noticed then iPhone version automatically imports time information into a generated invoice. However, I can not get the android version to do the same. I bill weekly by time worked. I need this functionality to be mobile because my desktop can do it, iPhone can do it, but android (at least on the galaxy note 3) cannot. I have to downgrade to 3-stars until feature is fixed. UPDATE: Developer replied quite quickly to my inquiry, and told me a way to do this on android. 5 stars yet again! Thanks guys.   Full Review          Hi Andrew,

Thanks for the feedback. The popup you see in our iOS apps is definitely something we want to add to Android apps. Currently, you can invoice for your time by going to Projects, tap on project you want to invoice, hit the green "Generate Invoice" button. You can look at http://bit.ly/1uBaWqv to automate your billing weekly to save time.                                   So far this app will really help me stream line tracking clients...the only thing id like to be able to do right from the app is run to client timers...i am in childcare and meed to be able to track the length of time i have each child to get an accurate billing amount at the end of the day so running 2 timers from the app is important for me. If therr is a way to do this in the app please let me know or if it becomes available that would be wonderful.   Full Review          Hi there Krystal,

Hope you are having a great Monday! Currently, there isn't a way to run multiple timers and switch between them quickly. I can see how that is important for the childcare industry. I have gone ahead and passed your feedback to the product team so they know what you would like to see in the app. Cheers, Ramin                                   We need to be able to deduct deposits paid when converting to an invoice.  This is really important in our business!   Full Review          Hi Andrea,

Thanks for the feedback and I agree with you on adding deposits to the service. What you can do now is create the invoice and then enter a manual payment before sending it out for the deposit amount so the client see's the partially paid invoice. Email support@freshbooks.com to get more info. Sincerely, Ramin                                   This app works seamlessly between my actual FB a count and the app on my phone. Its basically a dumbed down version.  But you can do everything you need to do  as far as send an estimate or invoice etc. The only thing i dont like is that  you cannot see all of the info about your clients on this app. I looked for a clients phone number and could not find it. So i looked at all of my other clients and none of them show this info. Oh well.  I still like the app.   Full Review          Hi Kevin,

Thanks for the feedback, really appreciate it! The client view should bring in the work and mobile number for the organization and will also bring in Phone 1/2 for secondary contacts. Can you email support@freshbooks.com with the field you would like to see so we can potentially add it in a future release? Sincerely, Ramin                                   When I try to log in through the app, it redirects me to the mobile webpage, then doesn't recognize my username. Will continue to use the PC version, but the app seems useless when I could just skip the step of opening it and go straight to the webpage with the same effect.   Full Review          Hi there Victoria,

That's a strange error you are seeing. Can you please email support@freshbooks.com and we will help you connect your account to the app? It requires the browser just for the authentication part. Sincerely, Ramin                                   It's an amazing and easy way to track my business expenses and profits without even have a lot of accounting knowledge, definitely I will be a loyal customer.   Full Review          Hi Thomas,

Awesome to hear that you are enjoying the app :) If you ever have a question or suggestion about how we can make the app better, please send a email to support@freshbooks.com and a friendly Support Rockstar will help you out! Cheers, Ramin                                   Please integrate an estimate to invoice option. So we can have one app for all our needs.   Full Review          Hi Ben,

Good news is we have estimates! If you swipe on the homescreen, you will see the second page of icons, one being Estimates. You can even convert the estimate into an invoice from the phone by tapping the "More Actions" button when viewing the estimate on the phone. Let me know if you find it okay. Cheers, Ramin                                   Can you guys please make the FB to be able to work with SA banks   Full Review          Hi there DJ,

Thanks for your feedback. Unfortunately, adding international bank support is not something that will happen in the immediate future. To make it easier to import expenses from your bank, you will need to import using the CSV option: http://www.freshbooks.com/support/can-i-import-expenses

Sincerely,
Ramin                                   I've been using Freshbooks for several years and have found it to be an invaluable resource for some of my billing and ALL of my estimating. The recurring billing has also been a perfect solution for me. I highly recommend Freshbooks!!   Full Review                                     Pretty neat!   I'm going to use this just for the receipt tracking.  It's worth it for that alone.   I'm a massage therapist so I don't really "invoice"  my clients and my quotes are verbal and take 3 seconds.   NOW...... Add ability to process credit card payments, and I'll fill in a client base and then we're talking business and I have no problem paying for the app and taking it a step further...   Full Review                                     I've been using the online version for a few years and love it. Recently got the android phone and added the app. I do my invoicing on the computer and mostly use the phone app for the timekeeping function and recording (not taking) of payments. I only have a couple of clients, and work sporadically, so it works for me. Their support system is excellent, so if you have problems and don't talk with them, don't blame the app.   Full Review                                     Excellent app. Performance is sometimes weak, even hanging at times, when doing PDF generation. Other than that, the only tool for freelancers.   Full Review          Hi Jennifer,

Thanks for the review, really appreciate it! Will get the team to see what we can do for PDF load times. Have you tested it on wifi to see if its due to network speed? Can you email support@freshbooks.com with what PDF reader you are using? Cheers! Ramin                                   I have a Galaxy Note 4 & this is an awesome app to have! I can take a picture of receipts & it captures the amounts. Also great to have and record uour daily expenses.   Full Review          Hi there Katherine!

Thanks for the great feedback, glad you are enjoying the app! If you have some time, would love to hear from you on what we can do to make the app experience even better.
