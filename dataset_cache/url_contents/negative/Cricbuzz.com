Sledging in the Second Test of India vs Australia & Reaction of Cricket Biggies on it.






We had seen few events of sledging in the second test and it was not good as a result as Jhonson scored 88 runs for that sledging's answer. Below I have gathered some information about the say by few former cricketers and big names of cricket.


Views of Cricketers In Sledging

The Indians are of the stern see that sledging was all right so long as Australia, England and South Africa did it. Not now that they are also doing it. "Now that we are giving it back, they can't handle it, " they all say in private. VVS Laxman tweeted as much when the Gabba Test was on. They also observe - as their western counterparts possess - tactical benefits in sledging. They are a confident, brash generation, not ones to take a backward stage when in confrontation.

In 2008 Robin Uthappa narrated an instructive incident to ESPNcricinfo. During the World T20 in South Africa, he said he had looked straight at Matthew Hayden only to be told, " What are you looking at? I have played 11 yrs of international cricket. Give me some respect. " Later, during the triangular series in Australia, MS Dhoni offered his boys free rein, and every time they saw Hayden come out, they would line up, start applauding and say, "Respect. Respect. "

The reason behind all this, Uthappa said, was: " They don't expect us to retaliate and, when we do, they don't know what to do. " Now there was a reason why nobody noticed this clever and witty " respect " retort back then. Because it was exactly that: clever and witty. Not personal and abusive. Uthappa admitted items got individual and abusive too. And they were noticed and seen. Somehow they always tend to do between India and Australia. They can get downright nasty, like the time when Shikhar Dhawan mocked the hurt Shane Watson with a bogus limp in Bangalore. How Dhawan got aside with that is a very clear mockery of ICC's spirit of cricket. The results haven't changed much: India still can't win in Australia even though theirs is a more unsettled part, they still beat Australia at home. Maybe, it is the skills that are more important.

These two teams' regular captains have shown no signs they are in any danger of taking a step back. Before the start of this season, Clarke spoke of how Australia will carry on their aggressive body language. Dhoni wants the sledging to go on as very long as it is carried out within the limits of the spirit of the game. He uses the words passion and entertainment almost every time he justifies some needle on the field. The spirit of cricket for him is to not be seen doing or saying items you wouldn't wants kids to observe and emulate.

Three Indians and one Australian have been booked for breaching the spirit of cricket. In just two Tests. Neither part has contested the costs; probably they know there are others who have got aside with it. It is, once again, a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode into another Jadeja-Anderson.
The damage, though, is done: go to any maidan in Mumbai and you will see school kids use some of the vilest abuse you will ever hear. A Mumbai coach in the mid-2000s told off a new import for not playing cricket the Mumbai way, for not abusing the batsmen.

When Dhoni put his foot straight down in pressing costs against Anderson in England, the by- product of the investigation was the coming to the fore of the incessant and inane abuse about a cricket field, the kind you wouldn't allow in any workplace. You would have hoped everyone would have been embarrassed, including the umpires for not looking at it. On the evidence of nine days of cricket in this series, nothing has changed.

The four players quoted at the top of this article, who talk of a game almost foreign to us younger viewers, played in the '70s, '80s and '90s. Has the game changed so much since they retired or are they looking at the past with rose-tinted glasses? Most of the players of that vintage blame Allan Border and Steve Waugh for introducing chatter as a strategy to win at all costs.

Neither those former players nor us watching from outside can remotely understand the pressures out there in the middle. The players have never been under such extreme scrutiny or attention before. Every little incident is reported and reacted to, which is probably why they seem to have increased. Earlier on this tour, former Australia batsman Rick Darling told this website that back in his playing days Shield bowlers used to give him outright dying threats while sledging. Possibly the incidents just look uglier through live coverage of every match. Possibly winning at all costs has indeed become more important.

Yet, that it happened previously too, that the pressures are higher today, should not be the reason to continue with abuse about the field. Individual abuse and ugly send-offs can be stamped out. Remember, probably the most celebrated and effective sledges have been inconspicuous. It is not a battlefield out there, no matter the number of war clichés spouted by lazy commentators and journalists. It might not become any worse than in the past, pressures might be bringing out the worst in the players, but it's never too late to start making a change for the better.
