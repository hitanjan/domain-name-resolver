Adam4Adam


Adam4Adam, a gay dating/relationship/romance site, loads a login form insecurely over HTTP – and then POSTs the login insecurely to HTTP. Anyone intercepting network traffic would be able to see your login credentials in plaintext.

Unrelated protip: 
This is also a good time to remind everyone that even HTTPS will not conceal the sites you visit, just the content you view on them. You may want to consider using a VPN if you need both protections. Always read the privacy policy, data retention policies, and terms of use for any VPN provider to ensure your data privacy will be honored.
