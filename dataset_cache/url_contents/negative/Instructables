Solar powered car? Maybe using Altoid tin/other metal body. I can't decide if it'd be too complicated, but probably too much to do in the same workshop with building a city. With parental help doable. Link to a video making it: http://www.metacafe.com/watch/8493845/video_game_high_school_vghs_ep_1/?source=playlist=1

                                                    Very easy, very cheap and good Balloon car. Only pay attention to the last minute or so! Easy enough for Tiger cubs to make with help.
