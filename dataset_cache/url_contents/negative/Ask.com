The Perks


Unlimited Paid Time Off
We mean it. Our employees are adults and we treat them that way. Read more here.


A Block From BART
Our D/T Oakland location is a block from BART and City Center, and across the street from Club One (we have a corporate rate for employees, of course). Come on over to the sunny side of the Bay and see for yourself why Oakland is called the Bay Area’s fastest growing tech hub.


Big company stability
with the nimble culture and career growth potential of a smaller upstart.


Ultra casual work atmosphere
You can dress up if you want, but you’ll be the only one. Well, except for Robbie.


Subsidized parking and commuting costs
As well as discounts at hundreds of places, including Apple, Dell, 1-800-Flowers, Red Envelope, Zipcar, Broadway shows and restaurants. All part of being a member of the IAC family.


And more…
Endless supply of snacks and refreshments, tuition reimbursement, charitable donation matching, and of course all the regular bennies, like super generous health insurance plans (medical, dental, vision), 401K with matching, pet insurance, paid maternity leave and more.
