Summary

Constant Contact needs to seriously consider buying email marketing hybrid and RTB platform LiveIntent.
        
A LiveIntent deal would bring uniqueness, a vertical structure And defensiveness.
        
With LiveIntent, Constant Contact would facilitate transfer of email, nurture the lead through the campaign, be able to facilitate analytics capture, and have programmatic proximity marketing capacity.
        
On the heels of an up-round fund raise, LiveIntent raised $32.5 million in its most recent round, I don’t know that Constant Contact has much more time to waste.
        
I think this makes perfect sense.
        




Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), a name that's a constant "no" for me because it has historically been unable to create alpha for the Nasdaq, should seriously consider buying LiveIntent. LiveIntent is a private email marketing hybrid that I've been hot on for a while now and that I believe is on the cusp of being out of reach from a reasonable acquisition standpoint. I'll explain both in detailing what LiveIntent would bring to the Constant Contact model as an overlay.So for starters, as I've said before, I actually like Constant Contact's underlying platform and business model - it really is solid. I have zero issues with management or the long-term viability of the company. Again, the only problem is that I can't buy the equity and take on the extra risk of owning it over the index when the index has historically put in the exact same total return.Constant Contact should get aggressive with M&A and spending to change this. History has shown us in time it will make up whatever is spent anyways.Constant Contact grows at a steady rate (factoring in some headwind from law of larger numbers). It has managed to hold gross, operating and net margins flat over time - again on on a larger overall top-line. It has managed to grow its balance sheet without the use of debt - which is rare, a sign of excellent management, and something it should be proud of accomplishing. Finally, it has managed to hold its share float steady - there hasn't been gross misuse of share-based comp and/or growth via share financed M&A. No complaints here.But Constant Contact has seen direct competitors pop-up, good ones like MailChimp, and indirect competitors that offer alternative routes to the same endpoint that Constant Contact looks to guide customers to. Most notably these are the Inbound Marketers, names like HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO), etc. The point is that slowly it's seeing its services and its model commoditized and that isn't good. I think that's a large reason why the market refuses to bid up Constant Contact shares despite the stability noted above.If Constant Contact acquires LiveIntent, which to be clear is speculation on my part at this point, it will have a vertical email marketing operation that will be unique to the space. Maybe for a long, long time going forward because there isn't another model that I'm aware offering what LiveIntent is. Based on what I know of  tech there's significant runway to a competitor mimicking its platform. Put simply, it would take time to establish whereas a competitor could be running a Constant Contact model almost literally overnight minus the customer base. This is important to note but imagine if a Salesforce.com or a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) wanted to get involved in this businessI noted the following in a Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) article detailing LiveIntent integration news:"LiveIntent, for those unfamiliar, is a private company that offers what is most easily described as a real-time bidding platform for email marketing - think The Rubicon Project (NYSE:RUBI)/Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) but strictly for emails. LiveIntent offers a fascinating (highly polarizing for those determining its value to housing platforms - Salesforce.com in this case) platform that uses end-user specific identifiers and data to dial-in email proximity marketing at the time the email is opened, not when the email is sent…To be perfectly clear, LiveIntent advertisements come in the form of email skins or whitespace fillers - the advertisements are not disruptive or directly distracting, at least according to feedback data that LiveIntent has gathered. LiveIntent also offers a programmatic delivery of customer owned (in this case Salesforce.com's customers) advertising inventory as well. This means that the customer (again, Salesforce.com's customers) can choose to use LiveIntent to programmatically deliver its own ads or it can choose to create revenue via delivery of outside party ads. In either case, so far LiveIntent has shown metrics that are impressive and that should benefit Salesforce.com customers (at least those metrics that have been made public)."With an acquisition Constant Contact would not only facilitate transfer of the email, nurture the lead through the campaign, and be able to facilitate analytics capture but it would be able to host its own real-time bidding platform for programmatic proximity marketing. Additionally, it would acquire LiveIntent's engagement data that won over Salesforce.com.Why is this important other than for obvious reasons?Well, if the data LiveIntent is using is compelling enough to drive platform integration with its technology and customer acquisition for its model, odds are it's good enough to do this at scale - it already has to some degree with LiveIntent having worked with over 400 brands and 750 publishers so far.What I'm saying is that the data presented to the above listed names either as a value-add for platform integration or as a reason to do business, while not disclosed as LiveIntent is private, was obviously compelling enough to win the day. My guess is that Constant Contact would do well to leverage this data into an uptick to growth and maybe much more.Currently Constant Contact is designed for the small business, not the enterprise. Which is great and obviously can be uber-lucrative - Constant Contact's market cap is $955 million and the company generated ~$90 million in Q1/14 revenues. But LiveIntent would provide that, would still provide an overlay benefit to the existing SMB customers of Constant Contact, and most importantly would give it more differentiation (MailChimp and some of the other name brand direct competitors don't have an enterprise focus either).But, on the heels of a huge upround fund raise, LiveIntent raised $32.5 million in its most recent round, I don't know that Constant Contact has too much more time to waste if it intends to execute an acquisition. With valuation unknown, but likely being valued at somewhere near 5X sales (that's a comp using mid-range sales multiples from Constant Contact, Marketo, HubSpot, Cvent (NYSE:CVT), Callidus Software (NASDAQ:CALD) and a few others as LiveIntent doesn't have a true publicly traded comparable) unless Constant Contact is prepared to make a much larger purchase it should consider this strategy soon.I think this makes perfect sense, especially for those long Constant Contact shares and CEO Gail Goodman.For now, I continue to recommend an avoid of Constant Contact.Good luck everybody.
