City of Adelaide clipper ship tour
05/04/2015 , 10:13 AM 										 by Ashley Walsh  			
						

It's more than a year since the historic clipper City of Adelaide was returned "home" to South Australia.Since that time volunteers have been working tirelessly to make the vessel safe for public tours.Initially visitors were restricted to the barge, which carried the ship back to Port Adelaide, but now the mid-deck area has been opened up allowing people to go inside and get a better appreciation of what life was like onboard.

During its working life the City of Adelaide made 23 return voyages between the U.K. and Australia, bringing migrants to a new life down under.It's one of only two surviving composite clipper ships.The vessel is currently at Dock 1 in Port Adelaide with daily tours at 10am, 12pm and 2pm.The cost is $20 per person or $30 a family - covered footwear is necessary.Ashley Walsh joined Peter Christopher from the City of Adelaide Preservation Trust for a tour of the historic ship.There are pictures of the clipper on the 891 ABC Adelaide Facebook page.
