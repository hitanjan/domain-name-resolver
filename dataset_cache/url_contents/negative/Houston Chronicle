Texas
Houston Chronicle

The Houston Chronicle was ready when Editor-in-chief Jeff Cohen initiated big changes for a new look and structure. Design consultant Roger Black was tasked to brand the Chronicle with a rough-and-ready Texan feel that wouldn’t “put on any airs.”
Black was inspired by the exuberant typography used by the grand Hearst papers of the 1920s, and centered on a fresh interpretation of the Venetian oldstyle with Christian Schwartz’s drawing of Houston for headline and deck. For the text version, Schwartz simplified many forms, walking a fine line between a serious tone appropriate to news and the idiosyncratic character that had sparked Black’s original interest.
New styles were also drawn of Benton Sans and Antique Condensed. Illuminating with energy and impact, the Houston Chronicle soars center stage befitting of its star. FB2003
