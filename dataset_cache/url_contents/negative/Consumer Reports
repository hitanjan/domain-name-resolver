What is it? The second-generation Edge is based on a platform shared with the commendable current-generation Fusion sedan. The automaker promises more refinement, better fuel economy, and more advanced technology.
The foundation is solid, as we are impressed with the Fusion’s ride and handling, finding the sedan to be fun to drive. The Edge will be offered in front- and all-wheel drive, with the company’s first standard application of an EcoBoost engine. In total, three engines will be offered: 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder, traditional 3.5-liter V6, and a 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6. All three will be teamed with a six-speed, paddle-shifted automatic transmission. The base turbocharged four-cylinder will produce 240 horsepower. Auto start/stop will be available to help improve fuel economy, and select models will benefit from active grille shutters to aid aerodynamics.
What is new or notable? Available technology includes blind-spot monitors; forward 180-degree camera; backup camera; radar-based cross-traffic alert; active park assist (works with parallel and perpendicular parking); forward, side, and reverse parking sensors; lane keeping alert; hands-free liftgate; heated and cooled front seats; and heated steering wheel.
CR's take: As notable as the 2016 model sounds, let’s be clear, the outgoing Edge is a marginal performer in Consumer Reports’ tests (scoring 66 out of 100 points), with much-worse-than-average reliability, subpar refinement and dynamics, and worse-than-average owner costs. Plus, even owners ranked satisfaction among the lowest in the segment. So, it is reasonable to expect with the host of claimed improvements and new technologies that the new model will be better.
When does it go on sale: Winter 2015.
