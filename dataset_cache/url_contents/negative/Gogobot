Biography
We Are Here! This may be considered a bold statement from an emerging band but take note: GoGoBot mean business. Bursting onto the Scottish music scene in 2011 with a strident mix of synth anthems, pounding rock base and infectious pop melodies, GoGoBot have taken the music scene by storm. 
Consisting of Marko Kelly (lead vocals and guitar), Rosie McClune (bass) and Gordon McNeil (drums), the band has developed a unique sound fuelled by their own eclectic taste and purpose. Vast arrays of influences such as the Scissor Sisters, Sparks, Muse, Bjork, Queen and Rush have merged to create a distinctive spectrum of sound. The group are not afraid to try new things and are keen to push boundaries with their music, reflections told with dark humour and intimacy, cleverly disguised within quirky pop hooks.
Referring to their music and attitude as ‘DIY’ the band built and kitted out their own studio in order to create a space which would accommodate their needs, 2011 has seen the release of the ‘See Saw Series’ - six singles released throughout the year, mixed by LA music producer Paul Lani (who has worked alongside David Bowie, Prince, Robbie Williams and U2 to name but a few).
The series has been a huge success with the singles being played on BBC Radio 1 Scotland (Ally McCrae), 6 Music (Chris Hawkins), BBC Radio 2 (Vanessa Feltz), Clyde 1 (Jim Gellatly), Clyde 2 (Billy Sloan), Moray Firth Radio (Marion Scott), Forth One, Northsound 1, Radio Borders, Tay FM, West FM, Sound FM, Clyde 2Q Radio, Original 106, Wave FM, Radio Pulse, Juice Brighton to name a few. Press coverage has included The Herald, Daily Record, Scotsman, Sun, The Sunday Mail, ScotCampus, Record of the Day and Music Week, with the band dominating music pages and receiving more often than not, the coveted Single of the Week title across the various titles.
The trio continue to go from strength to strength on the live circuit, from supporting Glasvegas on tour, to a high octave run of festivals including T in the Park, RockNess, Wickerman, Belladrum, Guilfest and Bestival where curator BBC Radio 1’s Rob Da Bank invited the band to appear not once but twice over the acclaimed weekend. Further prominent guest slots with a wide range of artists include appearances with Simple Minds, Big Country, Heaven 17, The Alarm, Olly Murs, and JLS.
To mark the finale of the ‘See Saw Series’ and a busy year on the festival circuit the band will be headlining to their home crowd at King Tut’s (NME’S best small venue 2011) on December 2nd. The appearance will mark a fitting end to a year of successful releases and electrifying live performances, this is only the start.

Do You Remember
Written By: GoGoBot
Do you remember when the music was fun, yeah?It was 1995, that’s the year that music diedDo you remember when your kids could have fun, yeah?Playing on the streets, everydayNow, all the kids have got guns
Can you tell me, where did we go wrong?Back in the day, when the nights went on and onIt ain't easy working nine to five, it’s a lonely world, it’s a lonely life  Ask yourselfDo we have the strength to go on?
Do you remember when the music was fun, yeah?It was 1995, that’s the year that music diedDo you remember when your kids could have fun, yeah?Playing on the streets, everydayBut now all the kids have got guns
I can’t remember, last we spoke as oneDo we need a war to get some change?Hope to God we make it on our own
How many times, how many ways, could you live your life and end this game?Hold your head up highTonight we come alive
Do you remember when the music was fun, yeah?It was 1995, that’s the year that music diedDo you remember when your kids could have fun, yeah?Playing on the streets, everydayBut now...
Do you remember? Do you remember? Do you remember? 
Do you remember? Do you remember? Do you remember? Nineteen Ninety Five
Do you remember? Do you remember? 
Do you remember? That music, that music, that music It was 1995, that’s the year that music died
Do you remember? That music, that music, that music It was 1995




First Class Fool
Written By: GoGoBot
Take a little timeConsider this questionAm I yours or are you mine?
Cover up that eyeAsk me no questionsBetter tell me no lies
Can we really own what we don’t know?Do we even care if the answer is no?
OohI’m a first class foolI’m in love, girlI want to show you with the back of my hand
Get a little paybackIn the kitchen You can grab the knife
Show me the meaningOf trouble and strife
Can we really own what we don’t know?Do we even care if the answer is no?
Can we really own what we don’t know?Do we even care if the answer is no?
OohI’m a first class foolI’m in love, girlI want to show you with the back of my hand
OohI’m a first class foolI’m in love, girlI want to show you with the back of my handThat I’m a man
OohI’m a first class foolI’m in love, girlI want to show you with the back of my hand
OohI’m a first class foolI’m in loveI want to show you with the back of my handThat I’m a man 




Is This Love
Written By: GoGoBot
I used to think that love was tragedyBut now I’m stuck this does not work for meI am confused my time breaks into twoThe times when I’m aloneAnd the times I spend with you
I used to think that I was capableThings moved too fast and now it’s physicalI dream about you every day and nightAnd the hours keep pushing by till I see you
Do you know?Do you know?Is this love?That I’m feeling
I thought that I was indestructibleBut now I know my heart is breakableYou came to me and now I’m yours foreverThat’s the price I, I have to pay to feel
I used to think that I was capableThings moved too fast and now it’s physicalI dream about you every day and nightAnd the hours keep pushing by till I see you
Do you know?Do you know?Is this love?That I’m feeling
Do you know?Do you know?Is this love?That I’m feeling
Do you know?Do you know?Is this love?That I’m feeling
I’ve got my wrists in chainsYou play your silly gamesI am confused but I don’t care Is this loveThat I’m feeling?




Survey Says Dance
Written By: GoGoBot
And the survey says dance!
D’you remember days of oldWhere we all had two left feetWe were young and we were boldNow we’re all stuck to our seats
Take a chance – Do the right thing, do the right thingMake me dance – Say the right thing, say the right thing, babyLose control - Don’t be shy baby, spin that record baby (till the break of dawn)Save your soul - Can you feel me?
And the survey says dance!You’ve got the whole word at your feetAnd you dance to any sound Just as long as it has beat
And the survey says dance! 
D’you believe in what you’re sold?Are you standing to the beat?I need love before I get old Gasping in the heat
Take a chance – Do the right thing, do the right thingMake me dance – Say the right thing, say the right thing, babyLose control - Don’t be shy baby, spin that record baby (till the break of dawn)Save your soul - Can you feel me?
And the survey says dance!You’ve got the whole word at your feetAnd you dance to any sound Just as long as it has beat
And the survey says dance!
Take a chance baby, don’t be shySpin that record baby, don’t ask whyTake a chance baby, don’t be shySpin that record babyCan you feel me?
And the survey says dance!
When the music says dance We can dance to this beatI can take off your clothesWe could dance in the street
When the music says dance We can dance to this beatWhen the music says




We Are Here
Written By: GoGoBot
I’ve been waiting for a lifetimeFor the right timeWait a minute ‘cause you know that it’s the right timeFor the next line	In the chapter of the story of my life
I’m overwhelmed By the possibilities, don’t be scaredI’ve seen the future baby, we are thereYou understandIt’s the future and you need to take my hand
We are hereLet’s spread our wings out where the air is clearOh Oh OhI’ve got a feeling that I can’t let go
Take me back I’ll be a good boyI’m a good boyI’ll be clean and well behaved ‘cause I have no choiceI’m in loveGot an arrow baby burning through my heart
I’m overwhelmed By the possibilities, don’t be scaredI’ve seen the future baby, we are thereYou understandIt’s the future and you need to take my hand
We are hereLet’s spread our wings out where the air is clearOh Oh Oh I’ve got a feeling that I can’t let goI can’t let go
We are here Let’s spread our wings out where the air is clearOh Oh Oh I’ve got a feeling that I can’t let go
We are here Let’s spread our wings out where the air is clearOh Oh Oh I’ve got a feeling that I can’t let go
We are here I can’t believe I don’t get scared I need thisI can’t let go We are here
