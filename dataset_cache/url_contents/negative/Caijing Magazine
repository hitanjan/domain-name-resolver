His pioneering editor Hu Shuli, described for her fiercely independent journalism as "the most dangerous woman in China" had quit with two-thirds of Caijing's staff, allegedly over a conflict on editorial independence. Wang, known for his ability to navigate the country's carefully controlled propaganda apparatus, considered how to rebuild the magazine without its star editor.Learning Objective: The role of individual leadership, institution building, and transparency in bringing public and corporate accountability.           0 Followers  ·   37 Views            Data provided are for informational purposes only.
