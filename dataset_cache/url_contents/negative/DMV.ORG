The New Look of Our License and Identification Cards

        We’ve redesigned our driver licenses and identification cards. The new design helps:
    

prevent counterfeiting
reduce the risk of identity theft
decrease fraud
meet federally recommended security features


        Your existing valid driver license or identification card will remain valid until their expiration date. When you renew, you will receive the redesigned card.
