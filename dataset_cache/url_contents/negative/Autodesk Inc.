Osnaps dont work properly with pen anymore, andvstill need to be online to edit existing text from a template, which is absurd.  Copying also copies everything twice which is a pain and you can't edit multiline text properly, it bugs out.  Also if youre working offline sometimes it updates to an older online version when you reconnect, wiping out your entire work (hsppened to me a year ago too)   Full Review                                     Wow what an amazing app   Full Review                                     The best app for architecture   Full Review                                     Great app as after having it you need not to carry a file of drawings every where.

Not good as it doesnt tell you this from the app store = missleading and you have to create a login account before you even open the program.

Full Review                                     Now.. I have drawings on SD and on device. But the app would not open them unless they are in cloud. What exactly is the free (trial) version for apart from learning my dropbox password?   Full Review                                     I'm certain it's fine for normal users, but I really need a 3d sketchbook. It apparently doesn't work for editing in 3d which makes it useless to me right now. I paid for the pro update under the understanding that the extra functions allowed editing, but it's only 2D editing, so... Disappointment. Live and learn, I guess.   Full Review                                     Doesn't show transparency in lines though   Full Review                                     Can't create new files without buying liscense, so it's useless.

It does this with digital construction blocks called 'qubes' that can be added, deleted, moved, stretched, sloped, shaped, rotated and coloured with a couple touches.Qubism has been designed from scratch with a dedication on touch operation and performance. Focus on and Zoom in on areas that need work at higher precision and Qubism will accommodate.Work is ongoing and takes a fair bit of my free time but constructive feedback is welcome. Please email me if you experience any problems.Exporting and saving Images and Models:Select the 'camera' tool from the leftmost menu and select the file type from the rightmost (tick) menu.•PNG: Show off your model to you friends, should work with any social and photo apps installed•JSON: Share you model with other Android devices running Qubism via email with this option•DAE: Export your model in Collada format to develop it further with tools like Blender or SketchupAll these files can be sent via gmail or saved to SD card if you have an app like 'Send to SD card' installed.Tips:All tools available in the menu only need a single touch to operate but the following shortcuts can speed things up:•Cancel operation in progress: Tap screen with a second finger while the first is still on the screen•Pan, Zoom and rotate: Use two fingers on the screen (e.g. pinch screen)•View: Place two fingers on the screen then remove one•Focus: Place one finger on a qube and tap twice quickly with a second fingerKnown limitations:•Qubes that are too close or two far away from the centre of the red axes will be cropped by OpenGL. Keep the red axes near the area you want to work on using the focus and pan tools before zooming in.•The line removal rendering options are not perfect, it trims outlines where two Qubes meet but this can have unexpected results.•Transparency requires Qubes to be rendered back to front, this is fine when editing but in camera mode this order is only calculated when the rendering mode changes and may be incorrect once you change the view. The new refresh button will appear once you change view and will recalculate the order but artifacts are still possible.•Out of Memory issues can unavoidably occur outside of my control. Qubism will save your model for you and it will have a ? for its thumbnail when you re-enter the application.•Qubism will never be able to load existing 3D file formats (Obj and even DAE) because it would be extremely difficult and often impossible to convert triangles meshes into qubisms internal format.

SchemataCAD viewer DWG/DXF      ELMER software s.r.o.     In SchemataCAD viewer you can easily view 2D CAD drawings stored on your tablet or mobile phone. It is also possible to open a drawing directly from an email attachment.Viewer opens CAD file formats:- DWG (up to the latest version 2013 - AC1027)- DXF (all versions)- SCH (format of software SchemataCAD)Viewer contains AutoCAD SHX standard fonts. Also are accepted other SHX fonts and shapes, which are in same folder as is a DWG/DXF file (or define folder with SHX fonts in configuration).Limitations:- Opening encrypted DWG files is not supported- Size of available memory is limited, sometimes it is not possible to open very big drawings, for example 20MB file size.- SHX "Big fonts" (Japan, Korean) are not supportedThis viewer is part of CAD application named SchemataCAD.

PadCAD is an easy to use CAD application designed for small drafting projects such as home additions, small remodeling projects and site surveys.  With PadCAD, anyone can produce clean, clear drawings and export them to a professional CAD application like AutoCAD.  PadCAD was designed with ease of use, speed and mobility in mind and is not a full blown CAD application. For small drafting or construction projects, it just works. PadCAD is ideal for general contractors, small architectural firms, appraisers and real-estate professionals. People looking for a simple CAD app to help with their small remodeling projects will find PadCAD to be the ideal drafting solution.  PadCAD has a shallow learning curve and is specifically designed for people with little or no previous experience with CAD software or drafting applications. PadCAD does not require an internet connection, except when you export a drawing. PadCAD can export drawings as PDF, DXF or image files (PNG format). This app requires a MINIMUM resolution of 960 x 540.PLEASE NOTE: PadCAD is free to download and use, but to save or export your drawings you will need to upgrade the app.  A one-time fee of $14.99 will be charged for the upgrade.Once upgraded, you can save or export any number of drawings as many times as you wish.Main Features : 1) Intuitive finger-based drawing and editing: Draw walls with your finger, then adjust them by dragging or stretching them. 2) Fine-tune controls: For greater precision, every element can be fine-tuned with numeric values for any of its attributes. Simply double-click an element to fine-tune it. 3) Unlimited Undo and Redo: Made a mistake? Made more than one? Tap the Undo button as many times as you need and start over. You can Undo all the way back to the beginning of your session or Redo to your current state. Don't you wish life had an Undo button? 4) Take Pictures: You can photograph the area you are sketching and associate it with your floor plan. A photo icon is placed within your drawing to remind you where your picture was taken. Double-clicking the photo icon displays the full image. This makes it easy to remember which picture goes with which area of the floor plan. 5) Intuitive Zoom & Pan: Use two fingers to zoom in and out of your drawing, just like you would with any other picture on the iPad. You may also pan the drawing simply by dragging your finger. The drawing area is 4 times larger than the iPad screen, allowing you to work on very large drawings. 6) Joystick: The joystick is a very handy way to rotate and move any element without using your fingers or typing in numbers. It provides a third alternative for moving or rotating elements and is one of the most-utilized features for advanced users. 7) Exporting: Export your drawing either as an image file or as a PDF file. Exported drawings can be emailed to any address you want. If you're in an area where there are no internet connections, you can save your drawing as an image file to your iPad's camera roll or save the current drawing within PadCAD by starting a new drawing.Please feel free to contact us with any questions: support@plugworks.com                                 Infinite Painter      Infinite Studio Mobile     We are not Sketchbook.
