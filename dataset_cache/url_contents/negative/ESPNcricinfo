ESPNcricinfo updated, looks gorgeous with brand new look and feel



Windows Phone Apps 
, Wednesday, Aug 7, 2013 at 1:01 pm EDT        






We've received multiple tips that ESPNcricinfo has been updated with a revamped interface. Instead of continuing to sport a rather dull and boring interface, the team behind the app has implemented a brand new design, better reflecting the modern UI that's utilised on Windows Phone and across the Microsoft ecosystem. What's more is the new look also brings the app up to speed with counterparts on iOS and Android.

Version 2 of ESPNcricinfo not only looks smart, but fast resume is finally working too. If you're not familiar with the app, it's a must-have for any cricket sports fan. Covering international matches, ICC tournaments and major domestic leagues including English county championships, Indian Premier League and Champions League, ESPN brings the latest cricket content to your Windows Phone.

There are some suggestions and complaints from users so far. The Live Tile could do with some work in a future update and be sure to be on the look-out for errors. You can download ESPNcricinfo from the Windows Phone Store (requires Windows Phone 8). Thanks, Crash1989 and Pulkit, for the tips!

        rockstarzzz      




Now that Ashes don't really have much left in it, they decided to push it on my phone! Meh for now. Bring on the World Cup in Aussies :P
 




 














        crash1989      




there are six more tests to go right? optimistic for Aus .
 




 
















        rockstarzzz      




Only 5 test matches in total!
 




 














        Winnabe      




Seven, ain't it? Including the one in November?
 




 














        pulkit10      




Could be a tied series for all ya know. The urn is lost but still, can be exciting
 




 














        Josh Harman      




ESPN has a cricket app but nothing for college football? Come on man.
 




 














        zahrans      




to be fair taken as a whole cricket has more eyballs and interest than american football.
but i understand your point. since it's from freakin' ESPN, and not for instance an app from bbc tms or wisden (cricket related sites)
 




 














        sholokov      




This app is probably from the cricinfo team. It was originally a separate company/website.
 




 














        tipu2185      




I am really glad they finally updated app for WP as well. 
 




 














        hipporama      




Classy looking app. Finally it looks and works like a windows app.
 




 














        sholokov      




Windows Phone.
 




 














        Winnabe      




Could have appreciated myself  too being credited with the tips, but hey! we cricket fans have got the big update for our platform. And am not complaining! :)
 




 














        rockstarzzz      




They get 33,586 average tips for each news article that makes to the front page.
 




 














        Winnabe      




*Gasp!*
 




 














        paulxxwall      




Now all we need is an update for the ESPN hub app its live tile update are bad plus when you get notification can't find it in the app
 




 














        Josh Harman      




Same with the ESPN Scorecenter app.
 




 














        aaa6112      




Love the design of the W8 version of this app. Have it on my Surface RT
 




 














        Winnabe      




It must be said though, that the icon with the 'C' in the smallest size tile looks really outrageous. Like a sore thumb on my homescreen. Hope they revamp that as soon as possible.
 




 














        sholokov      




+1
 




 














        pulkit10      




Agreed. The old icon looked way better and even the large/medium tiles look great.
 




 














        iboypx      




Finally
 




 














        Etios      




They have Unpublished the WP 7.5/7.8 version, so ESPNcricinfo for 7.5/7.8 users.
 




 














        tcadbury      




Looks amazing. Now update the ESPN app.
 




 














        Josh Harman      




Yeah, it sucks.
 




 














        zahrans      




no love for us 7.8 users?
we are still blessed with the old format.....
 




 














        Etios      




what love? they have even unpublished the 7.5/7.8 version, so don't hard reset your phone now or else extract the xap from the phone if you have a rooted phone using program manager app from XDA.
 




 














        dreonedon      




People still watch cricket the
World most boring sport
 




 














        Winnabe      




Around here we think, Cricket is the most elegant sport the world has ever known. :D
 




 














        Etios      




yup, to your horror many people watch cricket and its only getting more popular year after year in new countries due to new 20-20 format and even the players are earning in millions now unlike yesteryear.
 




 














        vizagdude      




Yup, the app looks great and feels great. They UI is much better now.
 
But after the live tile started working, when launch the App, it crashes and goes back to the home screen. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?
 




 














        Winnabe      




I can confirm that once you uninstall the app and re-install the app (using the link provided here), the app works perfectly again.
 




 














        archersvalley      




Bloody hell! I didn't even know if it was available at all! I never saw cricinfo advertising anything for WP on their website! All you can see is apps for iOS and Android. Good news nevertheless.
 




 














        nez99      




Yeah dude its crashing for me non stop even after a soft reset
 




 














        Winnabe      




Uninstall and re-install.
 




 














        nez99      




I really do lol at Americans insisting a single country sport should be represented better on windows phone than one of the biggest sports in the world ;)
