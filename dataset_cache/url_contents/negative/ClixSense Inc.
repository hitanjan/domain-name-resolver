Before you start going through the checklist:

1. This guide assumes you have a Clixsense account.  Don’t have a Clixsense account?  No sweat.  You can join Clixsense for FREE at http://www.clixsense.com/?3894201 (I will be your sponsor, and so we can work together at Clixsense).  By the way, don’t worry about upgrading to premium right now.  You can do that later as your earnings start to accumulate, you get more comfortable with Clixsense and your referral base starts growing significantly (say at least 50+ members in your 1st level downline).

2. You will need to set aside at least an hour or 2 per day to do this.  It will take a while to go through all of the checklist requirements (especially doing the tasks and offer sections), but the reward is worth it.

3. Log in to Clixsense and you are ready to begin.

Step 1: View advertisements



Here is the ads page on Clixsense. Note: the number of ads available to click on will vary each time. Ads are generally worth either $.01, $.005 and $.001 per click on average (varies by timer length, with the longer running ads worth more per click).

Go to the ads page and view ads.  According to the checklist, it says to only view at least 2 ads, but for maximum earnings from paid to click ads (especially when there is a lot available), I recommend viewing them all.  Important Note: the number of ads tend to vary and sometimes there are no ads at all to view.  If that is the case, you can skip this step for now and come back later (ads should start appearing sooner or later while you are logged in).  By the way, if you download the Clixsense toolbar, it will alert you whenever new ads appear.  Note: premium members usually get significantly more ads to click on each day, including 1000 “welcome” ads that appear as soon as you upgrade (they disappear after you view htem all) and are generally worth $.1 or sometimes $.02 per click on average (at least that was the case when I upgraded).  1000 ads at $.01 per click will earn you $10 back (almost as a rebate).  By the way, you can request payout as soon as you earn $8 or more.  Your goal: view at least 2 ads (preferably more).  Optional: for a fast start, upgrade to premium and view all 1000 welcome ads that appear.  It will likely take a while to view all of them, but you will pretty much earn an easy $10 or more right off the bat by doing that.

Step 2: Do at least 20 clicks on the Clixgrid.

The Clixgrid is essentially a game of chance where you can view ads for a chance to win extra cash (usually anywhere between $.10 and $5), and as a free member, you get up to 30 chances to win (premium members have 60 chances to win).  Personally, I find the Clixgrid to be overrated and most of the time you probably won’t win anything, but if you are doing the Clixgrid almost every day, you should win some money sooner or later and you consider that a bonus.  Your goal: view at least 20 clixgrid advertisements.



Step 3: Do at least 5 (or more) crowdflower tasks



Picture of the Clixsense Tasks Page. As you can see, there are many “odd” jobs waiting to be completed (by you or someone else).

This is where going through the Clixgrid will get time consuming.  These are odd jobs people post (usually outsourced through CrowdFlower) and involve things like answering questions, answering questions about websites, looking up search terms on Google/bing and posting your findings, flagging images, categorizing products, etc.  It will likely take a while to do at least 5 tasks as some tasks are more time consuming than others and will require you to use your head and do some research.  You will also find that if you do tasks regularly, you should earn a pretty good amount of money with the Clixsense Tasks system (more than you would if you just view ads).  The only downside to Crowd Flower tasks is that the system seems to be flawed and some tasks can be confusing and sometimes they don’t seem to rate you fairly (they flag your answers as incorrect even if they are right and you did your research, which does tend to be frustrating at times).  Luckily some tasks are easier to do than others, so I recommend starting with ones you like the most and focus on them.  Your goal: successfully complete at least 5 tasks minimum (you can do more if you want to earn more of course).  You will need to be patient too when doing this part.



  Step 4: Complete at least 2 (or more) offers or surveys from the offers board (can be free offers too):



Offers Page at Clixsense. As you can see some offers are worth more than others.

This is the GPT section of Clixsense.  You can earn extra income with Clixsense by signing up for mailing lists, filling out surveys, shopping at partner websites (like Go Daddy), watching videos, etc.  Choose at least 2 offers to complete and if you meet the requirements of the offers, you will get credit.  Note: if you do at least 3 offers, the site will waive the requirement of doing crowdflower tasks.   I also recommend choosing offers that pay more (like the daily surveys, which pays at least $.75 or more on average, and you can do up to 5 surveys per day, which equates to about $3.75/day from doing surveys alone).  Also, bear in mind that some offers are worth more than others, and some may require you to spend some of your money (cashback offers for example, though these can be useful to complete if you are shopping online anyway), but you can earn extra.  If you are tight on money, I recommend starting with free offers.  Your goal: do at least 2 or  3 offers minimum (preferably ones worth $.25 0r more for best results).

Step 5: Visit the forum

The forum can be a good place to connect with other Clixsense members, get tips, get the latest news as well as talking about paid to click related topics.  Visit at least 1 page in the forum go get credit (this is probably the easiest and least time consuming part of the checklist).

You are done.  You get a bonus (it is not a lot), but if you do this correctly, you should be able to earn up to $1 or $2 per day minimum with Clixsense (even without referrals).  I can’t promise you will earn at least $1 every time as it will probably vary depending on how many ads you do, how many offers you complete, how many tasks you complete successfully, etc but you will find that Clixsense can be a fast earning site if you do these tasks correctly.

Other notes:

1. For more earnings potiential, consider promoting your Clixsense referral link.  You could probably start by advertising on other paid to click sites or even traffic exchanges that allow them (by the way, some paid to click sites have built in traffic exchanges where you can advertise for free by viewing other peoples’ sites in exchange for them visiting yours). Donkeymails and Cashnhits can be good places to start if you need places to advertise (they have awesome traffic exchange systems too).  If you are looking for good traffic exchanges or safelists to join, I recommend visiting the Easy Downlines system (see banner ad on side bar) or TE Profits Marketing system as they teach you how to use traffic exchanges and safelists and give you access to some of the most popular ones on the web.  By the way social media can be useful for attracting leads.  Also, having your own website or blog can be pretty useful for advertising Clixsense as you can either host ads from Clixsense on your site or post about it (like the post I am making) and promote Clixsense that way.  If you need a professional looking blog, you might like what Empower Network has to offer (this site is hosted at empower network).  It costs $25/month to use, but you can make killer blogs (much like this one) and it is great for branding yourself as well as building an audience.  They even pay you to promote their services (you earn $25/month commissions whenever you refer new members to empower network, by the way, I am a part of the Prosperity Team, which is a team consisting of fellow Empower Network Members like you and me that aim to help each other to build their business and get the most out of Empower Network and blogging in general, you can check them out at .  Alternatively, you can build websites/blogs for a mere $10/month via Global Domains International.  Also Instant Blog Subscribers is another blogging service I recommend for Internet marketing.  You can also use sites like BlogSpot, Hub Pages, Youtube or Squidoo, but bear in mind that you don’t really own the content and their policies tend to be fuzzy when it comes to affiliate marketing related topics (like paid to click sites), which means that they can shut down your blog or lens at any time if they don’t like what you are posting about.  At services like Empower Network, Instant Blog Subscribers, or Global Domains, you have much more control over what you post about and don’t have to worry about your site being shut down.  Also, if you want to use Youtube to promote paid to click sites, you should read a post I made a few posts ago about 2 of my videos getting taken down and 2 strikes being added to my account (one was for doing a demonstation video showing of Clixsense and the other was for a tutorial I posted about Global Domains where I show you how to create custom redirect links using the GDI domain names).  I don’t really agree with them (ironically, youtube never specifically mentions that you can’t post about paid to click sites or network marketing companies in their terms or community guidelines), but it comes to show how fuzzy their policies can be and you might encounter those kinds of problems too if you use free hosting service.

Pros and cons about the Clixsense Checklist strategy:

Pros:

1. Can be a good way to earn while waiting for referrals to come in.

2. Rewards you for being active.

3. Multiple ways to earn

4. Bear in mind that Clixsense is not the only paid to click site on the web, so how much you earn with Clixsense is in addition to what you earn at other paid to click sites.

Cons:

1. Time consuming.  Obviously if you don’t have at least 1-2 hours a day to spend on Clixsense, this strategy might not be for you (you might be better off just viewing ads and focus more on building your referral base).  By the way, if you have multiple ptc sites (like I do, being a part of about 15 ptc sites myself), it can definitely be challenging going through the checklist almost every day.  This works best if you the extra time to do so and don’t have too many paid to click sites (say 5 at the most).

2. Crowdflower tasks can be confusing at times and the system is flawed (at least in my experiences with them).

Well that is all for now, and feel free to leave a comment below.  Like this post?  Please feel free to share it with others (you can click on the “badass” content button to simply the process of sharing this post).

General tips and strategies:

- Make sure you are doing your rounds daily.  At the very least, you should be viewing ads almost every day.  If you are not doing that, you will not get paid and no you can’t expect your upline to view ads for you (even if we wanted to, as the Clixsense policy only allows one account per person and they probably won’t look too kindly at members who seem to assume multiple identities such as logging into referrals’ accounts and viewing ads for them).  The more active you are, the more you will earn.

- When doing tasks and offers, choose ones that interest you.

- For more tips and strategies, feel free to visit the forum.

- Clixsense can actually be a good place to get referrals for other paid to click sites you might have (especially sites like Donkeymails and Clicksia).  Advertise your referral links on the Clixgrid and you should get sign ups pretty easily.  I got quite a bit of downline members myself at Donkeymails using the Clixgrid advertising spaces.

- Clixsense does have a ”human test” system in place (it is used to deter bots) when viewing ads as you have to click on certain images that appear above the advertisements for credit (usually a picture of a cat).

Warnings about Clixsense:

- Watch out for frame breakers.  It appears some people post frame breaker sites on Clixsense.  The site will warn you if you have come across a known site with frame breakers.



- Watch out for viruses/malware too.  While Clixsense does a pretty good job at filtering out undesirable sites (like ones with viruses) I have encountered a few of them myself over the years, so you will need to protect yourself.  If nothing else, I recommend getting yourself a copy of Microsoft’s Endpoint Protection system (or similar virus/malware scanners).  Also I find that Google Chrome (with the safebrowsing feature on) to be pretty useful too for preventing viruses/malware when viewing ads as it is pretty good about warning you if you are about to visit an infected website (Internet Explorer does not always do this and you might not know if a site is infected until after the fact and your virus scanner picke up on it).  I don’t want to scare you away from Clixsense, but I do want to look out for you and thought I would warn you about that.



Get rewarded for your activities online (such as browsing websites, watching viral videos, filling out surveys, shopping online, etc).
