Tips and Tricks

When you first start out you’ll want to get comfortable with the controls and how the game is played. Make sure you click on everything because there are various drop boxes with options and information such as upgrades or the ability to place troops in a given area. Before the battle begins make a note of how much gold you are given at the start of the level.
