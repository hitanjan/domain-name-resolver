This is a Phantom  Clear Body for B5M. A brand new body style has  hit the scene for the Brand New B5M from the mind of Pro-Line driver Lee Martin: the Phantom. Featuring a Stealthy cab forward look and sweeping  body lines that flow back to a single point, the Phantom has the style and  performance you have been looking for. The optional center fin adds additional  high speed stability and finishes off the design of this fresh looking 1:10 Buggy body. Lee Martin used the  Phantom to finish 2nd in the World at the IFMAR World Championships on  the challenging Silver Dollar track in Chico, California. Now you can own the  same winning body style as Lee Martin!
  To see what Pro-Line Drivers Ty Tessmann and Lee Martin have to say about the new Phantom  body check out the video here.
