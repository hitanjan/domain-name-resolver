  This is my second Fool book to read, but I've been a frequent consumer of Fool.com content since I've been investing. I read this book because I have a friend who is new to investing and I was hoping this would be a nice collection of information that can better equip him as he begins his foray into investing. It passes the test.I appreciate the Fool's balance of entertainment and rock solid investing principles. Even being familiar with most of the content, it was a valuable refresher of ideas that should guide every long-term investor.Side note: this contained much less shameless plugging of the Fool services than the other Fool book I've read. I like this. They mention their services, which is great because now you know they exist, but their best advertisement is the high quality content they consistently provide. And now as a Stock Advisor subscriber, I can tell you that it is worth paying for the subscription if you are an investor with a long time horizon. Much like the book, the content is insightful and entertaining.Kudos, Fools.


Comment






  Full disclosure: I'm a total Fool and yes, I work at The Motley Fool so my review may be somewhat biased. But that doesn't make what this book teaches any less true. This is an excellent read for the beginning investor and a wonderful reminder for all investors of just how easy it really can be and how important this subject truly is. Foolish investing is about investing in great businesses on a consistent basis, in the ups and downs, and letting time do the rest. This book helps hammer that point (and many more) home. Worth the read!

  Easy to understand for the laymen.  I could read the whole book in two days with few hours each day to spare, while resting after a long day's work.  This is proof that it is well written.  The links within the ebook point to the corresponding service of The Motley Fool website, which makes the ebook very useful as a blue print for someone who wants to start investing rationally managing his investments independently--not speculating-- without the need to trust the brokers blindly).  The reservations I have are:1. I did not start investing using the principles of this guide to validate the techniques and theory offered2. It is tailored to the needs of investor in the U.S.  For other markets one may need to adapt the knowledge of this guide3. Minor typos and one or more chart issuesTo close with positive outlook:1. I feel the guide makes good sense, and uses very clear language to me and I am neither experienced in the field nor English is my native language2. It seems very comprehensive and practical for organizing ones whole financial and investing affairs3. And all the the above good benefits for less than the price of cup of coffee; Motely is a "fool" to give this ebook away practically free, but again being "Fool" is their creed-- meant in a nice way of course.  Motley define why the chose the name and why being fool in Shakespearian context is favorable.  Because of asking such a cheep price, it maybe justified to consider the guide a contribution to free and democratize investing and thus counts favorably to The Motley Fool's contribution to social responsibility4. I appreciate the soft, nice sence of humor throughout the guidePlease note that I am not affiliated with the Motley financially or otherwise and I am not even a paying member, I only receive courtesy email newsletter by free subscription available for anyone.  Best Wishes!

  What a great book to get someone started with investing. I love the Fool's way of explaining thinks in a simple way. I'm looking forward to reading an intermediate book from the Fool. Thanks so much for the great read.


Comment






  I am sure the content is excellent but it looks like it was not reviewed before publishing. Look at the  preview. It has charts on compound interest growth that are incorrect. The horizontal axis is over 8 years. No way. The text says over 40 years, that I believe. The motley fool is better than this.

  Good brief read. I always enjoy anything from the Fool


Comment






  I was expecting more of a "how to", it's more of a "why" or "what".  I guess i'll have to keep searching to find out what a "stop" order is.


Comment






  Simple, straight to the point tips and suggestions for a begginer ingvestor! Definetrly reccomend it to a soon to be investor.
