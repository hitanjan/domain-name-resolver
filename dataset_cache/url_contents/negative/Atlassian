For a person to enter the timesheet for a single week where they work on multiple issues there were far too many data entry screens.Vendor responseHi Murray, thanks for the feedback. We have been rethinking the time tracking experience of Timesheets and the first iteration of that is available today in Timesheets 7.12 as we introduced the Worklog Calendar. This is only the first step, we are investing heavily making the experience for the user as painless as possible. If you would like to provide further feedback then you can use the Feedback button that is in the new UI or send us a line at support@tempoplugin.comI'm very unhappy about new feature that limits timesheet view, if You try to reach longer periods than 60 days You'll get an error message: Requested period is too large for this view
The Timesheet view can't efficiently display the requested period:
Configure a smaller period (max. 60 days).

Keep this in mind, while looking in to some project time tracking software.Pros: lets you easily link time to JIRA tickets, and if you enter your time one or more times per day, it's easy enough to use.  Cons: using it is somewhat painful, particularly if you're filling time in retroactively.  Page reloads on every data point entered rather than doing a straight ajax request.  The popup to enter a data point obscures the timesheet, and defaults to the current day, so when I'm entering time retroactively for the week or month I often accidentally enter time for today's date rather than the date I intended.  You also can't edit a data point if you assigned time to the wrong ticket.  You need to delete the data point and create a new one.  These little things add up to a pretty annoying UI.

Again, if you enter your time on a daily basis, it's a minute of your day dealing with a slow interface.  If you sometimes enter time retroactively, it's a complete pain to use.3 out of 3 found this review helpful

Pick the model that matches your Atlassian product, and the same rules apply:Server pricing:Products and add-ons are hosted on your servers.Licenses last forever and include 12 months of maintenance (support and version updates).You can renew maintenance after 12 months at 50% of the original purchase price.You can upgrade the tier of your host product and add-on licenses at any time. Upgrade prices are calculated based on Atlassian's formula (view example).Cloud pricing:Products and add-ons are hosted by Atlassian.You are eligible for support and automatic version updates as long as your subscription is active.Your subscription automatically renews every month. Annual pricing is also available.Your pricing tier for host products and add-ons is automatically upgraded (as necessary) when you add users to your instance.How do I determine my pricing tier?Choose the same user tier you pay for in the Atlassian host application. For example, if you have a JIRA Server license for 25 users, you should purchase this tier.Even if fewer users want to use the add-on than your host application license, the two licenses should match exactly.Do you offer academic, community, or open-source licenses?Add-on purchase and renewal is half-price if you have an academic license for your Atlassian host application.Add-ons are always free for community and open-source licenses.For more details about qualifying for special licenses, see here.Can I extend my free trial?You can extend your Server add-on trial up to 5 times - in other words, for up to six months.

Cons: using it is somewhat painful, particularly if you're filling time in retroactively.  Page reloads on every data point entered rather than doing a straight ajax request.  The popup to enter a data point obscures the timesheet, and defaults to the current day, so when I'm entering time retroactively for the week or month I often accidentally enter time for today's date rather than the date I intended.  You also can't edit a data point if you assigned time to the wrong ticket.  You need to delete the data point and create a new one.  These little things add up to a pretty annoying UI.\n\nAgain, if you enter your time on a daily basis, it's a minute of your day dealing with a slow interface.

Cons: using it is somewhat painful, particularly if you're filling time in retroactively.  Page reloads on every data point entered rather than doing a straight ajax request.  The popup to enter a data point obscures the timesheet, and defaults to the current day, so when I'm entering time retroactively for the week or month I often accidentally enter time for today's date rather than the date I intended.  You also can't edit a data point if you assigned time to the wrong ticket.  You need to delete the data point and create a new one.  These little things add up to a pretty annoying UI.\n\nAgain, if you enter your time on a daily basis, it's a minute of your day dealing with a slow interface.
