We’ll also support Annecy’s candidature to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. It’s a management decision and we think Olympic values best correspond with the values of the BPCE (Banque Populaire-Caisses d’Epargne).”The Caisse d’Epargne team is registered in Spain and has been managed by Jose Miguel Echavarri and Eusebio Unzue since 2005.The team is lead by 2009 Vuelta winner Alejandro Valverde and Paris-Nice winner Luis Leon Sanchez. New riders for 2010 include France’s Christophe Moreau and Colombian climbers Maurico Soler and Rigoberto Uran.Valverde was banned from racing in Italy in 2009 after Italian police claimed they identified his blood DNA with a bag a blood found in the Operacion Puerto investigation. Valverde is awaiting a decision on his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the ban, and the UCI could extend his ban worldwide.Perol did not comment on if Valverde’s position had influenced the bank’s decision to end the their sponsorship. Author: Stephen FarrandShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google PlusShare on RedditRelated ArticlesVuelta Rider Gallery: Alejandro ValverdeSeptember 02, 2009 3:32pmCaisse d'Épargne's dream team aims high Down UnderOpening ProTour round vital preparation for season's goalsJanuary 13, 2010 10:00amUnzué facing toughest sponsor search yetCaisse d'Epargne leaves a big hole to fillJanuary 22, 2010 10:08pmFuture looks bleak for Caisse d'EpargneNo new sponsor found for 2011July 09, 2010 11:21amRelated RidersAlejandro Valverde BelmonteRelated TeamsIlles Balears - Caisse d'EpargneCaisse d'EpargneCyclingnews NewsletterRegister to get our daily newsletter packed with the top cycling newsBack to top © Immediate Media Company Ltd.The website is owned and published by Immediate Media Company Limited.220 TriathlonBikeRadarCyclingnewsBikelyVisordownGolf MagicOutdoor MagicBrandsAdvertisingOur PeopleCookies PoliciesPrivacyTerms & ConditionsLicensing & SyndicationContact
