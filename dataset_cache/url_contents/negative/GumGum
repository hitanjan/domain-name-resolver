Twenty-year ad tech veteran hired to take in-image advertising to the next level.






GumGum, an innovator in the in-image advertising space, has announced the appointment of Steven Wise as SVP of marketing. He joins the company from YP, where he was VP marketing strategy and insights.  
Wise will lead efforts to expand awareness of GumGum's platform, which serves advertising within images of content that has already drawn interest from users. Due to their relevance, the ads are known to attain high levels of engagement.
Wise is a seasoned ad tech veteran. He spent a decade at RealNetworks, which pioneered streaming media software and subscription services, and rose to GM of marketing there. He also served as director of e-commerce at American Express for four years in the early '90s.
“I'm looking forward to helping GumGum tell its story to become a major force in the display ad landscape,” Wise says.
