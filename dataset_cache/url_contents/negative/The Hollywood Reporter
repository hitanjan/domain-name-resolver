In a feature that calls out Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke as leading "Hollywood's new actor A-list," she opens up to The Hollywood Reporter about her role on the hit series, her opinions about onscreen nudity, and how she feels about turning down the starring role in Fifty Shades of Grey. It's a busy week for the actress, who plays Daenerys Targaryen on the show. On Monday, she linked up with her costars and let loose at the Game of Thrones premiere in San Francisco. The new season kicks off in just a couple weeks, but until then, check out the Game of Thrones cast out of costume and see what Emilia Clarke had to say about her fan-favorite role in the candid interview with THR:

On the success of Game of Thrones: "Never in a million years did I think Game of Thrones was going to take off like it did. It's taken me five years to catch up with it. I'm still not sure I'm there."
On her Game of Thrones audition in 2010: "There was a huge, incredible plateau of fruit. I was like, 'Wow, I've arrived. This is a serious audition.'"
On turning down Fifty Shades of Grey: "No regrets . . . I'd done nudity before and was concerned with being labeled for doing it again."
