Cognesia has the answer. We transform anonymous digital data into highly valuable customer insight which enables you to create the right message, to the right person, at the right time. We help you improve retention, maximise conversion and deliver a single view of activities. By helping you orchestrate all your digital activities, we help you build revenue and improve ROI.
We’re in the perfect space. Unlike the free low end reporting tools which offer limited sophistication, or the default high end players who are expensive but offer limited capability, Cognesia is:

Innovative – we enable you to turn customer data into profitable actions
Customer-centric – with an emphasis on analytics, testing and personalisation
Agile – being fast, flexible and responsive to your needs
Cost-effective – through competitive and transparent pricing
High quality – we offer a personal, collaborative and local UK-based service
