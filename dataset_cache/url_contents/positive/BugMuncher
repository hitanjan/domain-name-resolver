Vital Statistics
BugMuncher automatically captures the really important information that many users simply don't know, such as the name and version of their browser & operating system, the browser plugins they have installed, and the path they took through your web site.
You can also pass custom information about your users into BugMuncher, such as an authenticated user's ID. This data is then saved along with the feedback report and screenshot.
You can then use all of this information to recreate the conditions under which the feedback report was sent, meaning you can fix bugs quicker, and keep your users happy.
