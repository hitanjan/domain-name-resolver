LeadBoxes
A LeadBox™ is a pop-up window that appears when your potential subscribers click on a
							designated link, image, button or text. LeadBoxes® can also be set to appear after a
							designated amount of time or when a visitor is about to leave your site.
							To see exactly what a LeadBox™ looks like, click

LeadDigits
LeadDigits™ allows you to capture email addresses and phone numbers through SMS text
							messaging. With LeadDigits™ you can collect leads any time your potential customers
							have
							their mobile phones. This includes conferences, concerts, during meetings, on real estate
							signs or in your brick and mortar business. To use LeadDigits™, ask your potential
							customers
							to text a specific word (known as a unique text identifier) to one of our designated phone
							numbers or short codes and collect their email addresses via text. Email addresses and phone
							numbers are automatically added to the list you choose from your integrated email service
							provider. You can even automatically sign prospects up for a webinar in the same text
							conversation.

LeadLinks
LeadLinks™ allows subscribers to join your list, sublist or subscribe to a webinar with
							a single click.
							Simply copy and paste a LeadLink™ into any broadcast email from you (or one of your
							affiliate partners) and subscribers can instantly register for your lists, sublists or
							webinars by only clicking this LeadLink™ — no need to opt-in or give additional
							information.
							This makes it easier than ever before for subscribers to join your list, and boost your
							conversion rates.
