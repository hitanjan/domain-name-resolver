One Tap to Ride
Uber uses your phone's GPS to detect your location and connects you with the nearest available driver. Get picked up anywhere — even if you don't know the exact address.






Reliable Pickups
When you request a ride, we’ll find a driver and let you track their location on the map. Feel free to put away your phone – we’ll text you when your ride arrives. Your driver’s name and car details appear in the app, and you can message or call if you need to.






Clear Pricing
View rates for your city in the app. You can also enter your pickup and drop-off locations to get a fare estimate for your trip.






Cashless & Convenient
You don't need cash when you ride with Uber. Once you arrive at your destination, your fare is automatically charged to your credit card on file – no need to tip. We’ll also e-mail you a receipt.






Feedback Matters
Drivers not only meet Uber’s standards, they meet your standards. After your trip, you can rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your driver.






Split Your Fare
Simplify your life and your fractions. Invite your friends to split the fare. If your friends opt in, each person’s credit card will be charged equally. No more pay-me-backs or IOUs.
