DtDNS :: Dynamic DNS service hosting for domains, secondary DNS, and free DNS hostnames






































Your Complete DNS Solution
DtDNS is a complete provider of DNS hosting and DNS management services with a focus on dynamic
			DNS and dynamic IP address management.  If you are on a dynamic IP address, we enable you to host
			your own services just as if you had a static IP address.  We can also provide DNS service for your
			domain name with our reliable, distributed network of DNS servers, matched with a web-based
			management interface that makes managing your DNS records easier than ever.  Founded in 1999, we
			are proud of our 15 years of outstanding service. 















Free Dynamic Hostnames
Have you found that hosting a web site or FTP server on your own home computer is close to
			impossible because you have a dynamic IP address that changes every time you connect to the
			Internet?  Use our Dynamic Hostname
			service and get a name on one of our domains (ex: you.dtdns.net).
DNS Hosting for Domains
DtDNS offers reliable, affordable Primary
			and Secondary DNS Hosting for domain names.  Manage your DNS entries with our intuitive
			web-based domain manager, and take advantage of our special features, like dynamic IP address
			handling and lightning fast update propagation.  Why do it yourself when we've already done all
			the work for you?
Backup/Secondary DNS Service
If you already have a DNS solution in place with the primary and secondary servers in the same
			location or network, consider our Secondary
			DNS Service.  This service can eliminate a single point of failure in your DNS resolution and
			provide continued service in the event of a system failure at your primary DNS server.
