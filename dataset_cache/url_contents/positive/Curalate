Goodbye silos, hello insights.
Point solutions are definitely not on point. As a digital marketer, you have too much going on with too little time to make sense of it all. Having your data spread out amongst a dozen tools doesn’t help. Regain control and your sanity. With Curalate you get one platform for multiple networks, campaigns, and even user-generated content, so you always get the bigger picture.





Make your presence felt.












Become the office hero.
Forward-looking brands use Curalate to go beyond social engagement. Curalate delivers consumer insights from social behavior to help you understand exactly what people want and how they want to see it. Now you can arm your organization with information that buyers, merchandisers, email marketers, search optimizers, ecommerce managers, and content producers can use to crush it, daily.





User-generated goodness.
User-generated content (UGC) is changing the way people discover content and purchase products. While product reviews are rational and critical, UGC is inspirational and celebratory. With Curalate, you can bring user-generated images from across the social web into your site, make those images shoppable, and keep people on site longer. Generating revenue never looked so good.
