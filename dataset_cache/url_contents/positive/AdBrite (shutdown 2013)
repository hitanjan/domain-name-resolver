Looking for AdBrite?

		SiteScout has acquired certain assets
		of long-time ad pioneer AdBrite.
		
 
The transaction gives us new technology that we can leverage on top of our
		existing RTB stack and includes cutting-edge video, data management and
		optimization tools (not to mention some excellent ad serving technology).
		




















Frequently Asked Questions

Regarding the AdBrite Acquisition






I have some outstanding issues with AdBrite. Who do I contact?
AdBrite shut down in February 2013 and SiteScout has only purchased certain
				intellectual property assets that formerly belonged to the company. If you have
				any outstanding issues with AdBrite, you will need to reach out to your
				previous contact there.


 



Is AdBrite's old traffic going to be avaiable from SiteScout now?
No. The former AdBrite ad exchange was shut down, which means that the
				inventory that was previously available on SiteScout through AdBrite is no
				longer available.

Does this mean SiteScout is now working with publishers?
No. At this time, SiteScout is not working with publishers directly. We only
				sell display inventory made available through one of our existing supplier
				integrations. If you are a publisher looking to monetize your inventory, we
				recommend that you contact one of our many RTB-enabled inventory partners.
