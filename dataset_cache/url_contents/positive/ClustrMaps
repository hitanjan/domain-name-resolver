Do you know your audience? You will with ClustrMaps! Visitors don't need to click on 
                           anything: just viewing your page is sufficient. We provide (free) the HTML that 
                           gives you a tiny map, like the one on the left. When it loads, it increments a counter 
                           and shows the locations of all  visitors to your page, cumulatively (even for huge 
                           numbers). Clicking on it zooms in to a big world map, and (optionally) lets you zoom 
                           in to the continents, as in the example above. For light users (under 2500 visitors 
                           daily) the service is free, forever, and stores cumulative totals up 
                           to millions of visitors. Paying users get extra 
                           features.
