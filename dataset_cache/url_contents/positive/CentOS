CentOS 7 Updates
 The CentOS Project is happy to announce the availability of CentOS 7 (1503). This release includes a number of new features including a major update to IPA, which adds support for two-factor authentication. Other enhancements include the addition of OpenJDK 8, the return of Thunderbird, and improved container support.
 We’re also expanding the availability of CentOS images across a number of vendors, providing official images for Amazon, Google, and more. For self-hosted cloud, we also provide a generic cloud-init enabled image. 
For more information about updates and improvements in CentOS 7, please check out the release notes or the release announcement in the mailing list archive.
