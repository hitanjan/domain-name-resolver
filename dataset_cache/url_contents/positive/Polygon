The World Ends With You returns to iOS after months-long absence

      By Michael McWhertor





  Four months after pulling the game from the iTunes App Store, publisher Square Enix has restored the iOS port of The World Ends With You, making the game compatible with iOS 8.
The World Ends With You: Solo Remix, the mobile port of the original Nintendo DS game, was removed from the App Store in February. The game was incompatible with the latest version of iOS and had been unplayable for months.
"We have confirmed a bug that prevents this game from running properly on iOS 8, and are currently investigating the matter," Square Enix said at the time. The game was then removed from sale with no clear timeline for a return to the App Store.
Version 1.2.1 of the game was released today with iOS 8 compatibility. The World Ends With You: Solo Remix costs $17.99.
The iOS port of The World...

PlayStation Vita's E3 upcoming games reel is a helpful reminder that the Vita lives on

      By Michael McWhertor





  Sony's PlayStation Vita didn't get much attention at the company's E3 media briefing last week; The Last Guardian, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Shenmue 3, the Final Fantasy 7 remake and other PlayStation 4 games dominated Sony's press conference. But there was a morsel for PlayStation Vita owners, in the form of a sizzle reel featuring portable games coming in 2015 and beyond.
If you blinked during that segment of Sony's E3 showing, that highlight reel is available to watch again, thanks to YouTube. There are more than a dozen upcoming PS Vita games showcased within, including promising titles like Severed, Super Time Force Ultra, Mighty No. 9, Xeodrifter and Persona 4: Dancing All Night.
If you're quick with the pause button, you'll also get a tease of other titles coming to the Vita — which...

“It is designed and constructed like a piece of art.” 


Inside the $499 aluminum NES that’s crafted like a Leica

      By Sam Byford





  Who would spend more than the cost of a PS4 on a video game console that only plays NES games? Well, who would spend thousands of dollars on a digital camera that can’t autofocus? Leica shooters, of course, and people of similar persuasion might just be interested in the Analogue Nt for their gaming needs. The Nt is a modern Nintendo Entertainment System hewn from a solid block of aluminum, and retails for $499 (plus an extra $79 if you want HDMI output and hardware upscaling).

There are countless knock-off consoles out there that play original cartridge games from systems of yesteryear, but few have focused on anything but functionality. Analogue’s Nt is designed to be an object of desire in its own right — a console that goes above and beyond its source material.

“We went through an...

PSN issues due to 'external' factors affecting some PS3 and PS4 users (update)

      By Samit Sarkar





  Some PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 users are having trouble playing games on the PlayStation Network, according to the PSN status page.
Sony's most recent update, which came at 1:25 p.m. PDT today, says that PS3 and PS4 owners "may be experiencing issues related to launching certain games or game functionality." The issues, which are only affecting gaming and social features, are "due to factors external to PSN."
The update says Sony is "tracking the progress of the resolution of the issue." Earlier today, the company acknowledged reports of slower-than-usual PSN download speeds. There's no word on whether the two issues are related.
The network problems aren't affecting everybody. We had no problems loading up Destiny or a digital copy of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition. In...

ReCore: How two companies are making one game with only an ocean between them

      By Dave Tach





  How do you make a game at two different studios on opposite sides of the world, simultaneously?The answer, according to the heads of both companies, is by drawing lines in the sand that might comfort the unnamed character in ReCore's first trailer.
"While it's an extremely collaborative environment, we try to put stakeholders in certain areas," Armature Studio's game director Mark Pacini told Polygon during E3.

ReCore made its debut during Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference, taking pride of place after Halo 5: Guardians' multiplayer reveal.
There was much behind the trailer, designed to set the tone for the game. On one side, in Texas, they have a toolbox for game development. On the other, in Japan, there is a philosophy that shapes the game being made. Everybody knows their...

Whatever happened to Robbie Bach?

      By Colin Campbell





  For the first time in five years, Robbie Bach is walking the aisles of a big game convention. He's smiling. This E3, dressed in a fuchsia shirt and no tie, the former head of all things Xbox is enjoying the novelty of being an outsider. 
As he cruises the carpeted spaces between the blaring booths of Nintendo, Sony, Activision and Ubisoft, he enjoys the garish din as a matter of nostalgia.
He wanders around the Microsoft booth and luxuriates in the notion that he doesn't need to fret and worry about staging a press conference. He doesn't have to sit in a stuffy room and pitch analysts and retailers. There are no nightmarish parties to attend.

Even the water puddles are transfixing in Uncharted 4

      By Brian Crecente





  Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a pretty game.
Delayed until spring 2016, the PlayStation 4 game wowed at E3 with both news that it would give you the freedom to explore, but also how graphically impressive the game looks.
Just how pretty is it?
When developers Naughty Dog was invited to speak at Gnomon School of Visual Effects, Games & Animation earlier this week, they managed to impress the audience with quite a few things, including a short video of ... a puddle.
You can see the puddle in action at 47 minutes and 45 seconds in the video.
If this sort of strip down of a game's graphic nuance floats your boat as much as it does mine, make sure you check out all of the videos from the evening's panel right here.
If you're more of a complete game person, then check out the video...

Her Story is a truly unique game, putting players in the role of a character trying to solve a 1994 murder with only a crappy police database and a series of fragmented video interviews. Join Megan Farokhmanesh and I as we discuss this powerful true crime narrative from Sam Barlow, who previously brought us Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.

Watch 11 minutes of Overwatch's heavy, Zarya, and her big particle cannon in action

      By Michael McWhertor





  Overwatch's heavy — one of them, at least — Zarya is the star of a new gameplay video released by Blizzard Entertainment, showing off her offensive and defensive capabilities.
Zarya wields a hefty particle cannon that both deals damage and surrounds herself or a teammate in a protective bubble shield. She can also launch a Graviton Surge bomb as part of her ultimate ability, which sucks in enemies and damages them for a period of time. You can see Zarya's talents in action in the 11-minute video above.
Over the past few weeks, Blizzard has released a series of gameplay videos highlighting Overwatch's team of heroes, including Bastion, Pharah, Reinhardt, Tjorbörn, Reaper, Hanzo, Tracer, Zenyatta, McCree and Mercy.
Overwatch is coming to Mac and Windows PC, with a beta planned for...

Battlefield Hardline Ultimate Edition owners on PS4 can't play DLC right now

      By Samit Sarkar





  Battlefield Hardline's first expansion, Criminal Activity, launched last week for Battlefield Premium members. But PS4 players who own Hardline's Ultimate Edition are reporting on the game's forums that they can't access the DLC right now.
"Criminal DLC is not playable for Ultimate Edition buyers on PS4," wrote Battlelog forum user Denyael on June 20. Players are indicating that they're able to download Criminal Activity, but the game doesn't recognize the installation. Owners of the Battlefield Hardline stand-alone game or its $69.99 Deluxe Edition, on all platforms, can access the DLC just fine.

  With Marvel's Ant-Man movie less than a month away, Marvel uploaded the trailer being shown in Japan for the July 17 release of the movie.
The trailer spends less time showing us Ant-Man running inside tunnels with his legion of insects and more time setting up Paul Rudd's character and motivation for taking on criminals.
Also, there's a surprise appearance by Baskin Robbin's Mango Fruit Blast. Enjoy!

Watch the latest Fortnite demo, from Apple's WWDC earlier this month

      By Charlie Hall





  A new Fortnite demo was shown live on state at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this month, and the team at Epic Games released it to YouTube just yesterday.
The in-game demo shows off a cuddly, brightly colored world where purple stormclouds fling waves of gruesome enemies against small groups of players.
"If you've ever built a pillow fort or battled imaginary monsters with your friends you already know how to play Fortnite," said Billy Bramer, lead gameplay programmer on Fortnite. "This is the end of the world scenario you've been training for since you were a kid."
The demo shows off the game's third-person perspective, as well as an unusual set of weapons including a broom and an acoustic guitar. Players venture out into the world to gather resources by...

Watch the entire Battleborn E3 demo in this 23-minute video

      By Christopher Grant





  Battleborn, as described in our E3 preview, "has a hell of a lot going on." At its reveal, Gearbox Software president Randy Pitchford described it as "a genre-fused, hobby-grade, co-operative and competitive FPS exploding with eye-popping style and an imaginative universe."
Okay ...
If you've found your eyes glazing over every time you read about Battleborn, know this: you're not alone. It can be a lot to absorb when simply seeing the game in action can better communicate its intent. So we're happy that publisher 2K is sharing video of the entire E3 demo, including some 20 minutes of gameplay. From their description:

The gameplay demo follows a team of five heroes on the planet Bliss as they infiltrate an old Peacekeeper base and attempt to close a portal that's allowing the evil...
