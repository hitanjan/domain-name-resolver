            The best of Admeld,
            now in DoubleClick Ad Exchange.
          

            Since 2008, Admeld has led the industry in helping premium publishers maximize their ad
            revenue and simplify their operations. Admeld pioneered the private ad exchange and
            built technology that made it easy for publishers to identify new opportunities and
            control how every impression is sold.
          

            Google bought Admeld in 2011 and we’ve worked diligently to build Admeld’s best
            features into the DoubleClick
            Ad Exchange. Now that we’ve completed the integration, AdX provides publishers a
            unique platform that combines robust, publisher-centric tools with a massive, global
            pool of demand. When paired with our ad server, DoubleClick for
            Publishers (DFP), the benefits of the DoubleClick publisher platform are even more
            compelling: it's one platform to maximize yield across your direct and indirect
            sales channels, on every format and every device.
