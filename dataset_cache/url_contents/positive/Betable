In a nutshell...
Betable is the only platform that allows you to legally offer real-money gambling in your games.

You tell our API that a game has started and needs an outcome.
We execute the request by determining the game's outcome and moving funds to the winner's Betable account.
Our API responds with the data your game requested.
You receive the API response and display the results to the player in your game.









Focus on making games, not acquiring licenses.

Integrate a better revenue stream into your games.

Monetize without sacrificing gameplay.









We have gambling licenses.

That's the simple answer to: "Why is it legal?" We're doing something very unique in a highly regulated industry, so we get asked this often.










Betable is licensed by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission. With our licenses, we can offer a wide range of gambling and betting services to players in legal gambling jurisdictions.
