Sharing Made Easy



Your business grows faster when it's easy for your users to tell their friends about you.








          Making your users type or copy/paste their friends' email addresses discourages sharing because it's so much work.
        


















          Allowing your users to upload their webmail or desktop address books to your website encourages more sharing and stronger social connections.
        



















Why choose CloudSponge?




Our widget will let your users input their friends' email addresses into your "refer a friend" form without typing anything.
CloudSponge integrates with the most popular webmail services including Yahoo, Hotmail and Gmail and desktop address books such as Outlook and Mac OS X Address Book.
Our API gives you full control over every pixel of the user experience if our widget isn't right for you or if you're building a "find your friends" feature to help your users make connections on your website.
The options are endless, you can use your user's contacts however you like.









 Single Access Point
Integrate once and get access to all of our supported address book sources rather than connecting to each one individually.


 OAuth User Consent
We use OAuth User Consent APIs whenever they're available because your users don't want to share their important passwords with anyone.




 Domain Knowledge Experts
We make sure your contact importer keeps working when third parties make changes.


 Software-as-a-Service
Reliable, auto-scaled service means that you don't have to worry about uptime or scaling.

"At SurveyMonkey, we're always looking for new technologies to help us build the world's most trusted online survey platform.  When we started work on our new address book, we knew that we needed a scalable and effective solution for importing contacts from a variety of sources.  We picked CloudSponge because of the features they offer coupled with their robust SDKs and support, and have found the service very reliable.  We were able to incorporate a variety of new address book import sources in a very short amount of time, and have really enjoyed not having to update our code when external APIs get updated."

"... Since implementing CloudSponge ... more customers get through the process of sending an eCard ..."

"Last year JibJab's customers began asking us in high frequency for a way to send their birthday and holiday eCards using their computer's address book and their email contacts. At the time, customers had to manually enter in the email address of their friends. As we looked at building a solution we quickly realized the complexity of building this product, supporting a multitude of sources and also updating the feature as the APIs of the sources changed. We ended up finding CloudSponge and were happy to offload all of that trouble to them.<br/><br/>
                          Since implementing CloudSponge thousands of customers have taken advantage of the feature. We also noticed that more customers get through the process of sending an eCard. We've also been especially happy with their uptime. The holidays are very busy for us and CloudSponge has been able to handle the high volume periods."
