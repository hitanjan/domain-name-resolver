LATEST EPISODES       David Gordon Green, director of George Washington, Joe, Pineapple Express, and now Manglehorn, does a Terrence Malick impression and talks about the fun of working with movie greats like Nicolas Cage and Al Pacino, where he got the name Manglehorn, and did we mention the Terrence Malick impression?         Director Joe Dante and actor Anton Yelchin visit the Tomatoes to answer listener's questions about cameos in their new film Burying The Ex, as well as how Anton preps for scenes with superstars. Joe talks about a new film he's trying to get off the ground, and politely accepts Grae's casting advice. Finally, a question about The Howling gets everyone all creeped out.         Writer/director J. Michael Straczynski comes into the studio to answer your questions about his new Netflix series Sense8, as well as Babylon 5, He-Man, Ninja Assassin, Night Gallery, and pirating (not the kind on the ocean). You'll also hear his nickname for the directing team and his frequent collaborators The Wachowskis.
