Donald Trump 
Undocumented Workers Can Stay ...
But ONLY if They Work Hard


        6/27/2015 1:00 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    



Donald Trump says if he's elected president, he'd let undocumented workers who are productive stay in the United States, but if they just sponge off the system and don't contribute ... he'd have them deported.
Trump tells TMZ,  he'd create a "system of merit," saying people here illegally should have "a road to legal status" if they work hard and contribute to the country.  
Trump also says no one really knows how many people are in the U.S. illegally -- he cites different stats that show the figure is somewhere between 11 and 30 million. Trumps says it's unrealistic and inhumane to attempt to deport all of them. Thus, the merit system. He says many undocumented workers are "hardworking people" who deserve a chance to live the American dream.
The candidate was not specific about the criteria for being "productive," but he was specific that people who don't pay their freight over a period of time have no place here. 
He also believes criminals and other "bad ones" should be thrown out.

Mariah Carey
My Billionaire BF Needs Spiritual Advice
Before Popping Question


        6/27/2015 12:50 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    



Mariah Carey and her billionaire boyfriend are taking a giant leap -- jetting to Israel for what they call a "pre-engagement spiritual meeting" with a religious muckety-muck.
Sources connected with the newly-minted couple tell TMZ, Mariah and James Packer are jumping on his jet today, where they will meet a "spiritual leader" who James knows well. We're told James believes the meeting is a must before he pops the question.
Our sources say once the meeting takes place, the ball will roll quickly and "they will be married soon."
Packer doesn't want the name of the spiritual leader or the location disclosed for security reasons.

Nick Gordon
Bobbi Kristina's BF
On the Hot Seat


        36 minutes ago BY TMZ STAFF
    


Nick Gordon, Bobbi Kristina's embattled boyfriend who has been a person of interest since her near drowning in January, was in no mood to talk when he was asked about her impending death.
Nick bolted from reporters who fired questions about the Fulton County D.A. saying they have a heightened interest in the case now that it's about to become a murder investigation.
Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown's daughter is now off life support and it is only a matter of time before she passes.
Nick was leaving a friends apartment Thursday in Florida when he was quizzed.

Justin Bieber
I Play Second Banana to My Pastor!!!


        6/27/2015 6:55 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    



Justin Bieber awesomely took second seat to the pastor of his new-age church ... and it's so fun.
The Biebs and Pastor Joel Houston were leaving Hyde nightclub in Hollywood Friday night when our photog tried jawboning with Justin.  But when J.B. wanted the pastor of Hillsong Church to get some face time, our photog obliged and the convo turned to surfing.
Houston -- who also fronts the band Hillsong United -- along with his co-pastor, Carl Lentz, are the spiritual advisers to lots of celebs. Lentz Baptized Biebs back in December.

Meek Mill Party
LAPD in Overdrive
For BET Awards Weekend


        28 minutes ago BY TMZ STAFF
    



Meek Mill's party was overrun Friday night by both clubgoers and cops, who were determined to keep the peace in Hollywood during the BET Awards weekend.
The rapper hosted a big party at Playhouse Hollywood, which was packed to capacity just after midnight. A slew of cops showed up -- on the ground and in the air -- to control the crowd and prevent a repeat of last year's violence during pre-show parties.
An eyewitness says YG was rejected after he refused a pat-down.
All was calm and it looks like only one or two people were busted for disorderly conduct.
One down, one to go.

Jill Dillard
I'm On a Mission
And Not for '19 Kids and Counting'


        6/27/2015 7:22 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    

There's a big clue that "19 Kids and Counting" will never see air again, because a key member of the brood is leaving the US of A. 
Jill Duggar -- one of Josh Duggar's victims -- just revealed she and hubby Derick Dillard are going overseas on an extended mission trip.
TMZ broke the story ... TLC was considering reconfiiguring the show so Josh would be out of the picture and Jill and Jessa would be front and center.  But with Jill out of the country, that scenario is no longer plausible.
As we reported, TLC has not made an official decision ... but we're hearing the chances of the show coming back are slim to none.

DMX
Add Another Arrest to the Pile


        6/26/2015 9:19 PM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    


DMX is getting within shooting distance of a deck of cards populated by his mug shots, because he was arrested again Friday night.
Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, the rapper was en route to Radio City Music Hall where he was scheduled to perform when the New York City Sheriff's deputies nabbed him for unpaid child support. Turns out there was a warrant for his arrest.
The law we know, he was being held in the back of a patrol car. 
As for the concert, Masters of Ceremony, the show went on without him.  It had plenty of other old school rappers to entertain the crowd.

La Toya Jackson
I Believe That's Michael in the Clouds!!!


        6/27/2015 7:14 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    



La Toya Jackson is a believer, and seems to think the eerie image of Michael Jackson in the middle of a thunder storm is the real deal.
We got La Toya and ex-fiance Jeffré Phillips were leaving Macau restaurant in Hollywood -- which they raved about -- when our photog showed M.J.'s older sis the pic.
La Toya doesn't think it's a mind trick at all.
As for her and her ex-fiance, they're together-ish, but they seem to have different views on the relationship.

Gilbert Arenas 
Ex Demands Restraining Order
Gilbert Claims Victory 


        6/27/2015 12:30 AM PDT BY TMZ STAFF
    


Gilbert Arenas' ex demanded an emergency restraining order against him this week ... claiming he threatened her life ... but the judge shot her down ... TMZ Sports has learned. 
It's no secret Gilbert and Laura Govan -- the mother of his 4 kids -- hate each other's guts. Arenas recently smashed the car she drives with a cinder block after she allegedly threw his computer in the pool. 

Now, sources tell us ... Govan went to court this week telling the judge Gilbert threatened her on Monday -- allegedly saying, "I want you dead or in jail or broke."
Arenas obviously denied threatening her ... and the judge ultimately ruled there wasn't enough evidence to warrant an emergency restraining order. 
After the hearing, Arenas gloated on social media ... saying, "Another victory in court ... I'm not the one to keep score but ur 0-16."

The Supreme Court made a gay poodle's day with its gay marriage decision.
