Digital Data Exchange

Feb 24, 2015
On January 31, 2015, Brilig stopped accepting data from its Exchange members and we have been actively working to cease all operations in connection with this business. This includes purging all data in our possession as of January 31, 2015, which we expect to complete over the normal course of business.  In the meantime, we have stopped storing any Brilig related cookies, we are no longer setting or collecting any Brilig-related cookies and the servers that supported the collection and storage of cookies are now offline and not operational. This combined with the data purge make it unnecessary for individual users to attempt to opt out.
