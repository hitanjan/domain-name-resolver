Here's what people are saying about us




 

We wanted to better serve our audience, who are distributed across the globe. Providing everybody with fast downloads is critical for us, and CacheFly has a network designed for this purpose.

Read case study




 

We tried CacheFly, and the implementation was extremely simple and easy. After a few months, we discovered that it was far more effective and superior than what we were using at the time. Things with CacheFly just work.

Read case study




 

CacheFly has exceeded our expectations on every level, from the technical operation of the actual service, to the top-notch support staff and their responsiveness.

Read case study




 

I expect best-of-class latency and throughput numbers and 100% uptime. With CacheFly delivering our content, I can say that we rarely, if ever, need to think about whether or not it is operating according to our expectations.

Read case study






 

Fortunately, getting up and running was amazingly fast and easy...We monitor CacheFly’s performance continuously, and it’s part of our infrastructure that we simply don’t need to worry about at all.

Read case study




 

We chose CacheFly after reading some reviews online where CacheFly was ranked to have the best performance. We also liked CacheFly because of the protected URL, origin pull, and pricing per MB features; good pricing for the amount of bandwidth we needed, and responsive and unlimited customer support.

Read case study




 

We rarely have to talk with folks at CacheFly. That’s a good sign. Many other companies have approached us since, but we’re so happy with CacheFly that we don’t even consider it.

Read case study




 

CacheFly exceeded my expectations. We absolutely would recommend CacheFly. The response time from support has been great. The portal works just fine.

Read case study






 

CacheFly was simple to use and straight forward. We needed a CDN that would be simple to integrate with, did what we needed it to do, and all at the right price. CacheFly was the natural choice.

Read case study




 

We chose CacheFly because of the large Content Delivery Network they offered, multiple server locations around the world that could offer high speed downloads to our clients globally, and the ability to protect download links.

Read case study




 

Everything I asked for, I was given straight away. It was painless enough. Compared to the big CDN that we used, things have been easy. There's also less bureaucracy with CacheFly. They're easy to work with. It's easy to make changes and get things done.

Read case study




 

When we tell a customer a new version is out, we don't have to worry about the abundance of traffic we'll get and if latency issues occur. It just doesn't happen…so, we've been real happy with that.

I consistently see that people on Twitter thank us for fast downloads. My hope was that we'd be able to offer great download speeds no matter where our audience was located. CacheFly has far exceeded our expectations.

When comparing CacheFly to the cost of bigger CDNs, there wasn't enough of a difference… A lot of CDNs will charge you for every hit. With CacheFly, that initial request is free. CacheFly does what it does, and it does it well.
