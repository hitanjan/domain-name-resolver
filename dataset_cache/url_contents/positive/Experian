Why is it important to check your Experian credit report regularly?
Many people frequently pay attention to their credit scores when they buy big-ticket items such as a new car or a home. While these are some of the most familiar reasons consumers monitor their credit reports, credit scores and reports are used for many other reasons as well. Good credit can get you better rates on common necessities such as car insurance premiums, cell phone contracts and apartment rental agreements. Some employers even check prospective employees' credit reports before making final hiring decisions. In addition, despite increased public awareness of identity theft, the crime continues to grow. Therefore, learning what's in your credit report, understanding your credit score, and monitoring your credit has never been more important.
Get to know your credit report and let Experian help you understand your report with answers to your questions. Experian is dedicated to help you on your path to financial success.
