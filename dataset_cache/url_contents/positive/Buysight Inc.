Buysight Acquired By AOL's Advertising.com Group

December 3, 2012
 
Dear Customers, Friends, and Colleagues,
Over the past four years, Buysight has developed an innovative suite of targeted display advertising products, building on our partnerships with online retailers, and rooted in our understanding of shopper purchase intent. Our retargeting and customer acquisition solutions have helped hundreds of clients increase their sales and realize a stellar return on their advertising dollar. Today we take the next step toward providing those clients with even more value and opportunities.
Buysight has joined forces with Advertising.com as part of the AOL family. Together, we represent the strongest targeted display advertising platform on the Internet. We couldn't have asked for a better fit for our team and our technology, or a stronger partner to offer our clients — present and future — an innovative and high performing suite of advertising products.
Buysight will continue to provide our clients with the personal service and attention that has resulted in so many strong and lasting relationships. Our leadership remains at the helm, committed to the company's long-term vision. Please know that your contacts will remain the same, our clients' account managers will continue as before, and there should be very little disruption as we become part of the AOL family. The new opportunities and strength that this acquisition brings should be felt quite soon, and we look forward to expanding our offerings for clients and partners on both sides.
We welcome any thoughts or questions and invite you to read the official press release.
Many thanks for your support and we look forward to a bright and prosperous future together,
The Buysight Team
