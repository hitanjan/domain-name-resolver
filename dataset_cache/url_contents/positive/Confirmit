Employee Engagement

Mobile Engagement

Contact Center

Channel and Trade Audit




													 


												Engaging with your customers is about more than customer satisfaction, it's about creating a dialog.

Insurance

												It is becoming increasingly easy for customers to compare insurance companies. Price remains a key driver for sales, but the experiences that customers receive throughout the sales, claims, and renewals cycle are vital to retaining customers in the long term.
Learn More




													 


												For financial institutions, it's crucial to create strong relationships with customers. The competitive landscape means you need to provide outstanding customer experiences to stay ahead. A solid Voice of the Customer program will help you understand what customers demand from you and how to meet those demands.

Learn More




													 


												The retail customer experience is core to achieving customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth and, ultimately, profitable growth. The experience needs to deliver on your brand's promise, and you need to understand where you are succeeding—and failing— so you can create retail experiences that keep customers coming back to you.
Learn More




													 


												For B2B companies, retaining clients is the difference between success and failure. Most operate on the 80/20 rule, and losing a top client often represents a significant portion of total revenue. A solid VoC program is essential to identify at-risk accounts, fix issues and leverage positive word of mouth to grow the business.
Learn More




													 


												Businesses across multiple industries use Confirmit to capture the Voice of the Customer, ensuring they provide customer experiences that promote loyalty, reduce churn and create competitive advantage.

Learn More

Learn More
