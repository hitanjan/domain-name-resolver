Get an eGain-powered customer engagement hub today!
Enhance customer experience, acquisition, and retention. Increase self-service adoption. Improve contact center agent productivity. Increase revenue through upsell and  cross-sell at the point of service. Ensure compliance and security in customer interactions. Reduce unwarranted field visits, product returns, and associated costs. Build customer loyalty through brand-aligned customer service.


Knowledge Management
Serve knowledge everywhere! Use the same knowledge base, and a range of access methods (search, browse, guided help, chatbot), for social, mobile, web, and contact center use.


Web Self-Service
One size doesn't fit all in web self-service! The same approach to self-service will not work for every type of customer, every type of inquiry, or every stage of the customer life cycle.
            
            eGain SelfService enables organizations to provide distinctive, productive, and brand-aligned self-service experiences that enable breakthrough improvements in customer self-service effectiveness and adoption, while allowing seamless, context-aware escalations to live customer service or sales agents.


Video Chat, Text Chat, Cobrowsing
Are you looking for efficient ways of providing better experiences to your website visitors? Studies show that chat and cobrowsing are the most effective channels for engaging, selling to, and serving online customers. Reach out to customers, proactively or reactively, right when they need help and avoid abandoned shopping carts and half-filled forms. Offer distinctive mobile customer service.


Social Engagement and Communities
In 2010, social networks collectively became the #1 online destination. Consumers are increasingly discussing their needs, soliciting and offering advice, and sharing their views about businesses like yours in these social networks. This free-flowing viral conversation is both a challenge and opportunity for your business. With eGain Social and eGain Community, monitor and join relevant conversations, and foster communities while crowd-sourcing knowledge.
