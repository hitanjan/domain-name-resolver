IF YOU BELIEVE IN CREATING A BETTER MEDIA INDUSTRY,











YOUR JOB SHOULD BE
AS COOL AS YOUR FRIENDS THINK IT IS

What do you say when you introduce yourself? Master of email chains? Commander of conference calls? Stop. You're creative. Smart. Good at what you do.
That’s why we’re making a platform that automates the frustrating and mind-numbing work you do every day, creating more space for creativity, strategy and analytics. Stop just-getting-it-done and start focusing on what’s really important: the bigger picture.









NOBODY EVER SAID:
“THIS IS MY BEST
SPREADSHEET EVER.”
