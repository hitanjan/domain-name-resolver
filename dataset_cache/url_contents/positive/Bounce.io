31B Bounces Per Day
				Email is designed to bounce.  Every day 31 billion emails bounce due to bad mailboxes, bad domains, resource constraints and hundreds of other possible issues.
			 
 
 



60% Open Rate
People read their bounces.  You can’t check something off your to-do list if it bounces back to you.  Bounces are the most widely read form of email traffic.
 
 
 



Confusing & English Only
Bounced email today is full of technical jargon and cryptic codes that non-technical people find confusing and stressful.  And, the nature of email means that bounce errors descriptions are sent almost exclusively in English!
 
 
 



New Threat Intelligence
Bounces are a leading indicator of network abuse and compromised accounts.
 
 
 
 
 



 

Better Bounces For All
When you route your bounced email to bounce.io, we run each one through a complex, patent-pending system to split the traffic into two groups:  machine mail and human generated mail.  Enhanced bounces are only sent to actual human senders, and the machine mail is captured as either a private data feed back to your network operations team or added to our global anti-spam trap feed.
		 
Better bounces for:

Your users - reducing inbox friction and support costs
Your network - stopping spam backscatter and identifying botnets on your network
Your bottom line - turning bounces into a new revenue and media channel
