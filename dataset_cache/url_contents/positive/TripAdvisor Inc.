Spotlight Destination





In the blue sunny Costa Brava, you will find a wide range of activities, from trekking and cycle-touring to diving and kayaking, not to mention the green golf courses and the browns of the cultural heritage. Our cuisine combines great creativity with wealth of local products. Salvador Dalí and Ferran Adrià are the two big names that have made the Costa Brava famous all over the world.
