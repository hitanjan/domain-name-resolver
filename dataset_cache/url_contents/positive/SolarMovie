Spoilers!

SparkyKarl ,

        
Lately Solarmovie has been plagued by the epidemic of people spoiling episodes / movies on the review comment page and I feel this needs to be addressed, please be aware that this is against the [https://www.solarmovie.is/rule...] and such activity will warrant a mute / ban depending on the severity of the spoiler! It does not matter even if you place SPOILER at the top of your review to warn people, it is forbidden and against the rules. A warning will only be Issued ONCE, if you continue to spoil a Mute / Ban could be enforced. Some small talk is ok, but mostly it is for reviews only, if you wish to talk about episodes / movies please take it to the forum, as such talk is not prohibited there..

If you would like to know what constitutes as a Spoiler, See Below:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S...]

Thank you for understanding... SparkyKarl.

Uploads quality

pirates_utd ,

        
Dear uploaders,

Please add links to TV SHOWS via TV SHOWS FORM not MOVIE FORM.
And fill ALL fields which are there with VALID data.

Those who fail to understand this simple requirement will be punished. Linkers will be demoted then banned, non-likers will be  banned right away.

Thank you. 
PS. those who do not receive notifications for new movies and episodes and see some movies "broken" or episodes missing can thank those beautiful uploaders that cannot fill forms properly.

Global Login Change

The_Boss ,

        
Hello fellow Solarians,
Few weeks ago we warned our users about a mandatory login change and today it happened. All login names were changed and if you are unable to login - you can check your new name [http://www.solarmovie.so/new-n...].

We also got a new feature for you. We added a reply feature, so from now on if you click on reply, the message that you're replying to and the nickname of the recipient will be quoted in your message.

And of course we nailed some nasty bugs.

Yeah, Don't watch this. Stay in yer bed while yer house burns down around you. Are you an activist? Are you breathing? Wanna keep doin that? Your dollar, your vote. Stop voting for evil...or get your speech ready for your children about everything and why you did nothing.

this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I know I probably have seen worse but  I can't think what it was. Don't waste your time on this. I give it 1/10

I couldn't believe this show popped up, really takes me back.  Interesting to note the production design, very reminiscent of "Mad Men" (or maybe it's the other way around, lol)  If Don Draper had been a private eye, I think he would've been Mannix.

Great_Scott,
        
Yeah, not bad at all. It seemed really cheasy at first, but once the action started this turned out to be a very watchable movie. Some minor quibbles, but a generous 7/10 from me as well.
