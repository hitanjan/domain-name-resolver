What People Say About Us



"Tinfoil Security is a service that scans websites to identify security problems. Co-founder Ainsley Braun ... came across a number of companies in her work who had security problems on their websites, she says, so she started Tinfoil to help companies find answers."





"Your data is one of your company's greatest assets, so investing in its security should be a top priority. ... One option is Tinfoil Security, which tests your website for vulnerabilities against virtual attacks."





"Ninety percent of SMB websites have been hacked. Two MIT grads, fresh out of IT security jobs in Washington, D.C., have launched Tinfoil Security, a start-up geared towards small and medium sized businesses looking to beef up on their site's security."
