WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAYI am extremely pleased in my experience with CodeFlavors products. I found exactly what I was looking for in plugin functionality for my website. It is rare in this day and age to find such a quality product coupled with such amazing support. I highly recommend it.





An extremely easy to use yet powerful plugin that does everything you need it to do and more. It is a truly remarkable platform for a featured articles slider, and is now my go-to plugin for making a site look perfect!




I really appreciate the support and plugin. My client is updating several Featured Articles galleries on their site each week and the plugin makes it really easy for them (and me) to keep fresh content showing up.
