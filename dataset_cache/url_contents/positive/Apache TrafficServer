Apache Traffic Server™ software is a fast, scalable and extensible HTTP/1.1 compliant caching
        proxy server. Formerly a commercial product, Yahoo! donated it to the Apache
        Foundation, and it is now an Apache TLP. Here's a Traffic
          Server overview.

Important security announcements:

	  All versions of Traffic Server prior to v5.0.1 (or v4.2.1.1) have a vulnerability related to
	  the synthetic health checks as used by traffic_cop. We urge everyone
	  to upgrade to the latest releases, either v4.2.1.1 or v5.1.2. See
	  CVE-2014-3525 for some details.
	

	  Traffic Server 5.1.0 has a security issue that can lead to acting as an open relay under specific circumstances.
	  Traffic Server 5.1.1 has a security issue which makes it vulnerable to denial of service attacks.
	  We urge all deployments of 5.1.0 and 5.1.1 to upgrade to 5.1.2. See CVE-2014-3624 and TS-2677 for more detail.
	









Overview







Caching
Improve your response time, while reducing server load and bandwidth needs by
          caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages, images, and web service
          calls.


Proxying
Easily add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add load
          balancing by adding a proxy layer.








Fast
Scales well on modern SMP hardware, handling 10s of thousands of requests per
          second.


Extensible
APIs to write your own plug-ins to do anything from modifying HTTP headers to
          handling ESI requests to writing your own cache algorithm.








Proven
Handling over 400TB a day at Yahoo! both as
          forward and reverse proxies, Apache Traffic Server is battle
          hardened. Also visit our Customers page (see link above) for
          some of our corporate users and supporters.
