   HOW LEADGENIUS WORKS



Technology + Data + Global Workforce
Software alone cannot yet identify meaningful buying behavior like real people. That's why we equip our talented, highly-trained team of global researchers with best-in-class search tools to scour dozens of public and private data sources. By combining human intelligence, custom data, and machine learning, LeadGenius delivers the highest lead generation value in the marketplace.
