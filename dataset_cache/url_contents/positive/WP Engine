We also perform proactive security and malware scans to ensure that all WordPress sites running on WP Engine are free from intrusions.

You can sleep easily knowing that the WP Engine team strives to provide the most secure WordPress hosting solution on the market.Why does WP Engine cost more than regular shared hosting? What makes WP Engine different from other wordpress hosting providers?There are many providers that offer bottom dollar hosting. If you are looking for the cheapest web host to run your WordPress sites, prepare to be hacked, run out of bandwidth, and possibly have your site shut off when you max out your allotted amount of monthly traffic. Is that worth saving a few dollars a month? In hosting you get what you pay for, and with WP Engine you get a lot. We take the SysAdmin work out of hosting your WordPress sites and allow you to focus on development and content instead of updates and maintenance. It’s an entirely different way to host.
