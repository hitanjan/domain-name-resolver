 Update    Information     During the next few days we roll out our new "Subscribe to Calendar" button. There may be corrections on our website while we roll it out.      Fixed     Fixed a minor tracking issue.    Update    Fixed     Many users have reported that when a website / web app has been added to "Home screen" and the "Add to Calendar" button is clicked, iOS fails to load the event.iOS error:Download Failed. Safari cannot download this fileWhen in "Home screen" mode iOS has many security restrictions. We have solved the issue by taking the security into account.The javascript resources "1.5.8.min.js", "1.6.0.min.js", "atemay.js" and "ate-latest.min.js" have been updated.    Update    Information     We are currently working on building a "Subscribe to Calendar" button (a calendar for recurring events). The feature will be an extension of the existing "Events Manager".We will be alpha testing the functionality later this week. Hopefully we can "soft launch" it starting next week.As the development takes much of our time, please expect a little longer response times on support.
