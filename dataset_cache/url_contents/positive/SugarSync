Why SugarSync?






Why SugarSync?







Powerful and Simple
Sync just a few folders or sync all your folders. Simply right click on any folder to add it to SugarSync. The entire folder is continuously backed up in real time providing you access to your folders anytime, anywhere, from any PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. Start editing a file on your office PC and finish it at home on your home Mac.







Secure File Sharing
Whether it’s to collaborate on team projects, distribute view-only files, or simply post links to documents on the web, you have complete control over how you share your files. Invite specific people to access your files and control whether they can only view them or edit them too. Don’t need to restrict access? Generate a public link so that anyone with the link can view your files.







Remote Wipe Your Data
Remote Wipe makes it simple to remove all synchronized files from a PC or Mac in the event of loss or theft. It also makes it easy to transfer ownership of a computer — you can rest assured that all personal data stored in the cloud has been removed from a machine after you’ve used Remote Wipe. And, because the data remains in the cloud, it can easily be synced to a new, replacement device. We believe we are the only company providing this level of control and security for both a PC or Mac owner.







Mobile Productivity 
Get stuff done on-the-go. Use SugarSync on your iOS or Android phone or tablet to access, share, and manage your files from anywhere. Edit a file and it’s instantly updated so you'll see the latest version when you're back at the office or at home.








Browse, access, back up, and sync online.All from your mobile device.
