Can HTC Aero Help the Company’s Failing Business?HTC’s latest flagship failed to impress anyoneLike BlackBerry, well-known smartphone maker HTC isn’t doing so well in terms of making profits rise while its smartphone business is concerned.

The device maker has announced the One M9 flagship during the same day as Samsung unveiled the monstrous Galaxy S6, which proved to be a big mistake because everyone raced to see the Galaxy S6 and immediately forgot about the One M9.

The thing is, the One M9 proved to be incapable of differentiating itself from other competing models on the market, but also from its predecessor, the One M8, which bears a very big resemblance to it.

So it’s no w...E3 2015 Was Great for All Gamers and CompaniesAll sorts of big surprises and announcements were madeE3 2015 took place last week and delivered a huge amount of news, announcements, surprises, and even a few awkward moments. However, one thing is quite clear: it's a great time to be a gamer, no matter the platform, and all sorts of big things are coming from developers, publishers, and hardware makers.

E3 is eagerly awaited by millions of gamers every year and the 2015 edition didn't disappoint, as most gaming companies brought forth a wide array of demonstrations, announcements, and goodies for their fans.

Bethesda blew many away

For its first pre-E3 2015 showing in history, Bethesda made...Batman: Arkham Knight PC Purchases Should Be Refunded by Warner Bros.The company should also continue to deliver patchesBatman: Arkham Knight was supposed to be one of the early contenders for Game of the Year, the swan song of a celebrated series and the final title in the franchise that Rocksteady would work on, a title that fans have been waiting for ever since Origins failed to live up to its own pre-launch hype.

Those who have picked up the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4 versions of the experience have been having a good time with it over the past few days, but for PC gamers, the most recent launch from Warner Bros. has been a nightmare and the company has not gone far enough to apologize and to compensate them.

...Did Anyone Notice GitHub's Competition Lately?Google is re-entering the source code cloud hosting market with its Cloud Source Repositories serviceWhen a company is dominating its market like GitHub is doing with cloud-based source code hosting, people tend to take their eyes off the competition.

In the last few months, GitHub has been busy trying to raise a new private funding round, but so have its competitors, quietly moving in the shadows and waiting for GitHub's mistakes.

Google is re-entering the game

After closing down Google Code this winter, Google is apparently back in the business through its Cloud Source Repositories service, which has entered a beta testing period.

This new tool provides developers with the ability to host G...Mr. Robot TV Show Talks About Linux, KDE, GNOME, Hacking, and It's AwesomeThe script is great and offers a new level of entertainmentI don't know how many of you out there are aware of a new TV series called Mr. Robot starting Rami Malek as a computer hacker that goes by the name of Elliot and uses Linux kernel-based operating systems to hack various entities.

Created by Sam Esmail, the Mr. Robot TV show began airing on June 24, 2015, on the USA Network channel. It aims to be an American psychological thriller–drama series developed for television.

"Follows a mysterious anarchist who recruits a young computer programmer (Malek) who suffers from an anti-social disorder and connects to people by hacking them," r...NASA’s Europa Mission ExplainedIf there’s alien life on Europa, NASA vows to find itThe movie industry has a knack for making aliens into vicious monsters thirsty for human blood, and you can’t really blame it for doing so. Having teeny tiny microorganisms travel from deep space all the way to Earth only to chase people around would hardly a blockbuster make.

And yet, this is precisely what scientists over at US space agency NASA have in mind when they say they hope to soon find alien life: microscopic life forms similar to the bacteria that populate our planet by the gazillion. 

How soon is soon? 

Earlier this year, during a panel discussion at NASA’s headqu...Is BlackBerry Too Late in Joining the Android Bandwagon?BlackBerry continues to be a struggling companyIn recent days, we have seen a wide variety of rumors concerning upcoming BlackBerry handsets surface online. It appears that the Canadian company is avidly trying to get back in the game and is willing to resort to a few new tricks to make sure its efforts are noticed.

We've told you that the company has a new Porsche Design model coming out, which leaked as the Oslo smartphone, and we’ve also told you about the Prague and Venice handsets.

What’s particularly interesting about these two models is that they are rumored to be coming out on the market with Android OS on board out ...
