Security
Our operations team continually monitors your business performance and watches for traffic patterns consistent with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. If necessary, we deploy a comprehensive operational and escalation protocol to mitigate risk and maintain the ability to take orders. Additionally, we run redundant architectures across our cloud network, so in the event of a major disaster in one location, we have the ability to have your sites fail over to another point of delivery. And each client’s isolated environment is logically and virtually separated from that of other clients, offering enterprise-class security and control.
