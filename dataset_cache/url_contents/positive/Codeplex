A highly customizable gallery/showcase plugin for jQuery.

Choose effect, should the image slide in, or fade in? You can even write your own animation function.
Show fifth image by adding #ad-image4 to the url, this takes precedence over over settings.start_at_index
Create permalinks to specific images, by index or id Listens to changes to the url to make linking to specific images easier jQuery call returns gallery instances, which enables you to change settings on the fly like the "Change to fade effect" link above
Keyboard arrows to move back and forth Click on the edge of the big image to go to the next/previous Images are preloaded, and if they aren't finished loading when they are supposed to be displayed, a loading image will appear
Slideshow count down only begins when the image has loaded and is visible Image title, can either be set in the title attribute, or in elm.data('ad-title', 'My title here'). $.data takes precedence over the title attribute
Image descriptions, can either be set in the longdesc attribute, or in elm.data('ad-desc', 'My description here'). $.data takes precedence over the longdesc attribute
Callbacks on different events that has access to the internal object, which means that you can access all internal methods, etc
Takes the dimensions of the image container div and scales down images that are larger than it
Image is positioned in the middle if it's smaller than the container div Images that are larger than the container are scaled down to fit inside the container
