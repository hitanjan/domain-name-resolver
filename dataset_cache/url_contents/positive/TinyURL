Welcome to TinyURL!™
Are you sick of posting URLs in emails only to have it break when sent causing the recipient to have to cut and paste it back together? Then you've come to the right place. By entering in a URL in the text field below, we will create a tiny URL that will not break in email postings and never expires.

Enter a long URL to make tiny:



Custom alias (optional):
http://tinyurl.com/

May contain letters, numbers, and dashes.

An example
Turn this URL:

http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Globally/dp/B003FSUDM4/ref=amb_link_353259562_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIK
X0DER&pf_rd_s=center-10&pf_rd_r=11EYKTN682A79T370AM3&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=1270985982&pf_rd_i=B002Y27P3M

into this TinyURL: http://tinyurl.com/KindleWireless
Which one would you rather cut and paste into your browser? That's the power of TinyURL!

Redirection to any page in your site!
With TinyURL, you can also make a smaller URL that will work for any page on your site. Let's say that you have a website with the homepage that is at: http://www.my-internet-isp.com/~myusername
Entering that URL into TinyURL will create a URL like http://tinyurl.com/3
With this you can then redirect someone to anywhere within your site by appending a slash and the pages filename to it. So if you have a page at http://www.my-internet-isp.com/~myusername/my-links-page.html, you can use the URL http://tinyurl.com/3/my-links-page.html and going to this URL will forward the visitor to the page in your website.
Hide your affiliate URLs
Are you posting something that you don't want people to know what the URL is because it might give 
away that it's an affiliate link? Then you can enter a URL into TinyURL, and your affiliate link will be hidden from the visitor, only the tinyurl.com address and the ending address will be visible to your visitors.
