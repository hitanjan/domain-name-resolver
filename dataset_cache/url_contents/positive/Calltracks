Overview of Calltracks software explaining the features and benefits, including:   Ultimately Calltracks lets you oOne of the things that's awesome about web traffic is that you can follow the trail and see exactly where sales come from, unless, of course, someone comes to your website, picks up the phone, and actually calls. As soon as that happens, the trail goes cold. Did this call come from paid or organic traffic, search or referral channels? Yeah, you have no idea. This is why you need Calltracks. Calltracks is a call tracking solution that tells you everything you need to know about your call traffic. First, they show you the trail for where each and every call comes from, which tells you which marketing channels actually make the phone ring and which don't. Then Calltracks takes things a step further and actually shows you which calls result in sales, through their sales linking service. This gives you an even deeper understanding into your web channels so that you not only know which channels make the phone ring, but which channels ultimately deliver sales. Now, you can tailor your campaigns to specifically drive profitable and valuable calls. Stop spending money on campaigns and keywords that don't deliver a good return, and spend more on ones that do, even if they're not driving the bulk of your calls. You can review all your call data in Calltrack's own user-friendly interface, or integrate it with other software like Google Analytics to see every customer's journey and learn how their calls compliment online conversions. And Calltracks works globally in over 70 countries. You need to know as much about your phone calls as every other customer interaction. With Calltracks, can finally see what you've been missing.
