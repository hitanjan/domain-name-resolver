Customers feedback




Once I enrolled in the new MacKeeper assistant program I was pleased at how courteously and quickly they explained the problem and were able to have a technician start within several minutes to diagnose and correct the problems. I am now a very happy customer and for a reasonable charge have a fully functioning unit that I can depend on again.

While Macs are almost bullet proof, your product keeps my Mac running fast, clean, and fully protected! Have 3 licenses for all 3 of my Macs! Keep up the good work.

MacKeeper gives me peace of mind. Whenever anything even a little hinky happens on my Mac, I run a scan.
