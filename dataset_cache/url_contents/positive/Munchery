        “What’s for dinner?”
        Finally has an
        easy answer
      


Chef-Made Meals
Our chefs use fresh, seasonal ingredients to make affordable, tasty, nourishing meals.


Order From Daily Menus
Our menus change everyday, with plenty of entrées, salads, sides and even kids’ meals to tempt you.


Delivered to Your Door
Use the website or app to order on-demand or schedule delivery up to a week in advance.


Cold on Purpose
Meals arrive chilled so everything stays fresh. Heat in your oven or microwave and dinner’s done on your schedule.








Meet Our Chefs
Munchery chefs come from top restaurant kitchens. They bring mad skills, tons of passion, and expertise in a delicious array of cuisines. They insist, as we do, on using only the freshest seasonal ingredients.






Beyond Our Kitchens
We think it’s good business to do good, so we seek out ways we can improve the world around us that connect deeply to our work.

Our Goal: Be Sustainable In All Ways
Our packaging is made from recycled and/or compostable (bamboo and sugar cane fibers!) materials. Our deliveries are made by bike when possible, and we off-set the impact of car deliveries by planting trees through The Conservation Fund.











Ready When You Are
Meals arrive chilled so everything stays fresh (no soggy lettuce or overcooked chicken on our watch). Simple directions tell you the final step, which is usually a few minutes in your oven or microwave, but may be as quick as drizzling on the dressing. Dinner is ready when you want to eat.
