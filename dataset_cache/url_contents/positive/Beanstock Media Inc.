About Us

New & Improved
Beanstock Media is the world’s first Publisher Trading Desk. With our Helix™ platform, we offer a cloud based yield management system that aggregates demand from every available source simultaneously to ensure maximum yield for our publishers.
Beanstock Media was created by industry veterans who get it. In recent years there has been an explosion of technological advances in display advertising, but almost none of it has been focused on the publishing side. From the start, Beanstock Media’s goal has been to develop tools and services to make publishers more money and provide human value without human overhead. With our approach, our clients are laughing all the way to the bank.
The Publisher Trading Desk (PTD) approach brings the demand side level of optimization to the supply side. Helix™ exposes each impression to as many demand sources as possible through a parallel auction and looks for the highest bidder in real time, not pre-determined averages.
Unlike other players in the space, we aren’t tied to just exchanges. We work with all demand sources, managed and programmatic alike to guarantee our publishers the maximum yield on every single impression.
Beanstock Media represents over 400 quality publishers including several comScore top 50 sites exclusively, representing unique, hard-to-reach audiences in the USA and around the globe.









 




 
 














Publishers











Work with us to put your inventory in the cloud and you’ll get sky high results. People see all kinds of things in the clouds…shapes, faces, fuzzy bunnies.  We see dollar signs for you through decreased costs and higher CPMs.
You may have noticed that managing your yield management through an ad server isn’t the most efficient way of doing things.  If you’re tired of “optimizing” based on out-dated averages, discrepancies between every server hop, being charged ad serving fees for passbacks and are all too familiar with the “fall-to-fill” concept, then we should talk.  We have a better way of doing things without disrupting the technology you currently have in place.
Our Helix™ platform is a cloud based solution.  Rather than the “waterfall” effect with decreasing CPMs, we run a parallel auction in real-time to every type of demand source simultaneously.  This works just like a real-life auction.  As more bidders participate, the price goes up.
And, we don’t disrupt your current ad server.  You can keep using it as you always have to manage your direct sold campaigns and embedded demand sources.







How we “Stack” up
A typical “waterfall” set up in a common ad server compared to the Helix™.














Tired of tech jargon and empty promises?  We are.  We know your goal is, ultimately, to truly maximize your ad yield.  And, you’d like to do that without sacrificing control over which ads run on your properties and managing any potential sales channel conflicts.  We’ve got you covered.




Our Helix™ platform provides publishers with:







Better Control

No Sales Channel Conflict
Quality control of advertisers and banning capabilities
Transparency on what’s running








Higher Performance

Minimize latency

Expandable and rich media enabled 100% of the time








Maximum Yield

Lower (or no) discrepancies
Highest bidder for every impression







 
 














Advertisers




Business as usual: Only Better
As an advertiser you want control over where your ads appear, how much you pay, access to all possible inventory and guaranteed placements.  Right?  You’ve come to the right place.  With our real-time, parallel auctions you know where every ad will appear and placement is guaranteed when you have the winning bid.  It’s that easy.  And, since your participation level isn’t pre-determined based on previous averages, you have more chances to find your elusive audience at the right time for the right price.
Beanstock Media represents over 400 quality publishers including several comScore top 50 sites exclusively, delivering unique, hard-to-reach audiences in the USA and around the globe.
Beanstock Media doesn’t work with advertisers or agencies directly, but working with us is easy.  On the demand side, you don’t need to do anything special on your end to connect with our inventory or access our Rich Media capabilities.
Beanstock connects with all the major exchanges and other demand sources, so you can keep doing business as usual and still reap the rewards of transparent, quality placements on our sites.
