Fix Bugs Faster

              Detailed stack traces help you fix errors in seconds, not minutes. Drill down on recurring exceptions or filter by parameters, users or environment variables. Intelligent grouping and duplicate detection means you don't get overwhelmed by trivial errors or a mass of emails.
            



Intelligent Exception Handling

              With deploy tracking, logging, dupe detection and a dashboard to track your exceptions, managing and triaging errors has never been easier.
            




Improve Team Productivity

              Use our error dashboard for insight into the health of your application. Intelligently filter important errors from the noise, and track error rates, exceptions since last deploy and more critical information from one location.
            



Collaborate with Your Team

              See who is crushing bugs, who’s causing them, and manage triage easily with our workflow integrations. Track errors to specific deploys, and integrate Airbrake in your workflow with HipChat, GitHub, JIRA, Pivotal Tracker and 30+ other integrations.
            




Secure Bug Collection and Handling

              SSL security means your sensitive data stays that way. With custom parameters, you can ensure you're alerted when potential security threats occur.
            



Robust Error Tracking
Airbrake sends more than 12 million emails each day and can handle more than 30,000 requests per second. Our world-class exception tracker can handle anything your app can throw.
