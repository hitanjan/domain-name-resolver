Is it easy to set-up?
Heck yes, it is! In fact, it takes just a couple minutes, and can even be done with zero technical knowhow.


Is it relatively inexpensive?
It's that, too! When compared to eye tracking or user testing efforts that cost thousands more, it's a complete no-brainer. 





One of the first things people find when using Crazy Egg is that their users are clicking on things that aren't even links. Where might that be happening on your site?
      Stop guessing what's working, and start seeing it for yourself. Put Crazy Egg to the test for , on us.
