Case Study – automated reports of opportunities emailed to specific staff members
+-*An example of using individual reports emailed to staff who are interested in company visitors to specific parts of the website.  See the full case study.



 In financial terms it’s a no-brainer, having easily paid for itself in no time. The A1WebStats system has also been really useful to help us make beneficial changes to sections and pages within our website.

										James Osborne
											Harvard Engineering
 








Case Study – paying for the system before spending a penny
+-*This 30 day trial subscriber used A1WebStats to identify a visiting company, made contact with them, and gained their business within a day.  That paid for the A1WebStats system for the year ahead.  All without spending a penny initially.  See the full case study.



 During the trial period and feeling adventurous, I sent an introductory email to one of those visiting companies and within 24 hours had converted a new customer, which paid for the system for a year!

										David Stewart
											Redblu Graphics & Displays
 








Case Study – settling a dispute between agency and client
+-*When a client accused their agency of failing in their SEO work, A1WebStats helped to prove that the agency has done their job and it was the the client that had failed to provide strong website content.  See the full case study.










Case Study – analysing every company that visited
+-*By looking at every company that went to the website and identifying them as either client, potential client, or competitor, Metcalfe Briggs apply different strategies to each visitor type.  See the full case study.



 The A1WebStats support team have been there every step of the way to explain how the web stats work and more importantly, how we can use the information which we have obtained in order to take our business forward.

										Karen Mitchell
											Metcalfe Briggs
 








Case Study – a need to call in the experts
+-*When a law firm created their own Google Adwords account, it was A1WebStats that helped to prove how inefficient it was.  See the full case study.



 I really don’t like what it tells me but I can’t deny what it says.


 








Case Study – being visible for the wrong keyword phrases
+-*What’s worse than not being visible in Google?  Being visible under the wrong types of keyword phrases and getting an artificially inflated view of website visitor numbers.  See the full case study.










Case Study – capitalising on lost opportunities
+-*Being able to identify the name of the visiting company and the keyword phrase they used, this subscriber was able to gain good insights into what their prospective clients were interested in.  See the full case study.










Case Study – comparing enquiries to visitor data
+-*Instead of responding immediately to enquiries gained, this company analyses which pages those people visited and how long they spent on each page.  Then they focus on those who appeared to be more serious, based on their website movements.  See the full case study.



 This makes life a lot easier because I can now see which visitors from other countries are worth investing time in and which aren’t.

										Steve Hayward
											Major Project Finance
 








Case Study – confirming the need for website changes
+-*High Google Adwords costs led to analysis of those individual visitors, using the A1WebStats system.  This led to changes to the Adwords campaign and also strengthening of the website, leading to lower cost per aquisition.  See the full case study.



 I hate statistics but I love this. It’s not statistics I’m seeing, it’s actionable information. I think I’m becoming a convert.

										Guy Scantlebury
											Sash Glass
 








Case Study – cutting down on wasted Adwords clicks
+-*By identifying Adwords clicks that weren’t leading to much website interaction, A1WebStats helped to weed out weak keyword phrases and focus the budget on phrases that resulted in visitors looking at the website in more detail.  See the full case study.










Case Study – getting more out of SEO
+-*By comparing numbers of people landing on specific product pages, to the number of enquiries gained about each product, it highlighted the opportunitity to strengthen some website pages where the enquiries vs landers ratio wasn’t good enough.  See the full case study.










Case Study – identifying website weaknesses
+-*By identifying the page by page movements of companies that didn’t make contact, this subscriber identified opportunities to strengthen their website.  See the full case study.










Case Study – identifying which sources of advertising work best
+-*By analysing the visitor paths of people who made contact, this business was able to accurately identify which sources of advertising were working best for them.  This included the revelation that their website SEO wasn’t as strong as it was perceived to be and that magazine advertising was working for them.  See the full case study.



 If I hadn’t seen the statistics with my own eyes I wouldn’t have believed that those website pages were stopping many people from making contact. The visible evidence doesn’t lie though – this is clever stuff.

										Paul Keeble
											East Coast Heating
 








Case Study – linking keyword phrases to website changes needed
+-*By comparing numbers of visitors who went to particular website pages to the number of enquiries about each product, this subscriber was able to see which parts of the website needed strengthening.  See the full case study.



 This proves for a fact that we need to invest more time in our website strength and less time on driving traffic to it.

										Caroline Lawton
											Plane and Simple
 








Case Study – looking for return on investment
+-*Using referrers data, this subscriber can identify which visitors are coming from certain websites, then comparing those visitors to the number of enquiries gained.  This helps to identify which websites generated the stronger levels of enquiries.  See the full case study.
