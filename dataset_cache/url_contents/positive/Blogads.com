Testimonials

Advertising with Blogads is a terrific, cost-effective, way to reach opinion leaders inside and outside the beltway.
 I’m a huge fan of the Blogads platform and the flexibility it affords
our campaigns. 
When I need to find a particular market, whether broad or niche, I think BlogAds. 
 Blogads makes sense for almost any advertising campaign. 
 Blogads is ahead of the competition as a thought leader on advertising in social media.
 
 Blogads offers a high ROI as compared with magazines, TV advertising, and other Internet ads.  
 The blog culture targets an audience that regular online campaigns cannot -- real people talking to real people. 
 Blogads lives up to their promise. 
 Blogads is an amazing tool that helps you advertise on some of the hottest sites on the net! 
New York blogs are a great way to advertise live shows! 
I do a majority of my online advertising with Blogads and Adwords.
 
Blogads.com is the 'Intel-inside' the blog revolution. 
 

We have been blown away by the results of our blogad buys and by the range of reporting and advanced blog searching services offered on your web site.
 
I am so happy with all your company has done for my business. 

 My favorite 'buzz seeding' tool currently is the amazing network over at BlogAds.com in part because of the interesting things you can do when you leave the IAB standards behind.  
 BlogAds has been an enormously successful component of nearly every online media campaign I've developed."
 
 I'm very pleased with the ROI on Blogads, both in terms of new clients and resumes for our political staffing company.
 
 Having experimented with Blogads last year, we've devoted a much-increased portion of our marketing budget to your service this year.  
 We were very pleased with the Blog campaign for VH1 Celebreality.

 I found the staff at BLOGADS to be top caliber. 

 I love using the blogad combination of image and link-filled text.
 
 Blogads makes it a snap to create and customize our campaigns, and the traffic they send to our book and author sites is significant.
 
 I've been extremely pleased with the success of our BlogAds campaigns. 
 
 My company has only been online 19 days, and sales are way ahead of expectations.
 
 Businesses and ad agencies that dismiss blogs and blog ads are nuts!   
 After my ad for Klezmer Christmas started running yesterday on TalkingPointsMemo, my traffic was up five or six fold.
 
 Thanks for the blogads service. 
 
 With blogads I'm getting about 50% of the customers as [name deleted].com delivers...  for about 5-10% the cost.  
  I like Blogads; I'm getting a better click-thru rate on them than I had on BCentral banner ads, for the most part.   
  As a veteran Google advertiser and guy who understands the importance of anharmonious color schemes in obtaining Ebay Power Seller status, I'm excited by Blogads.

 
I was pleased with the clicks I got advertising on www.amylangfield.com.
