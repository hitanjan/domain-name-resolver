Testimonials from our clients




“The Private Ad Exchange has enabled Sky to open up additional revenue streams through our existing inventory without impacting our current sales structure. The interface is really user friendly and streamlined and the support from Admeta is excellent. For over a year now we've worked with Admeta and they have been an excellent partner, we will continue to work with them for foreseeable future”



Tim Hussain,





"I can highly recommend Admeta's Private Ad Exchange. Due to Admeta's ad exchange solution we have been able to reach new customers and have seen a substantial increase in our online profits. It's all about maximising our daily income through optimizing the usage of our ad inventory. This is a challenge and possibility for all publishers with unsold inventory."





Fredrik Johansson,







“Through the Admeta Private Ad Exchange system we have found a way to turn a challenge into an opportunity. The increased demand for CPA and PPC is something we now can handle since Tango optimises our eCPM. Thus the advertisers themselves to a large degree carry the responsibility whether their ads will get a high priority or not. Admeta is an innovative company with an excellent product and we predict that they will get a lot of attention in the near future.”



Ole Andreas Sandbo,





“The Private Ad Exchange is a friendly and easy to use Performance platform. In a market focused on results, it is an optimization platform that will make a publisher´s life easier. Text Ads format should help publishers gain new revenue from advertisers used to Text links but willing to have an alternative. We in Prisa Brand Solutions changed our sell model to add CPC and CPL based on Admeta technology, and the result are better every month.”



Gonzalo Ochoa Abal,
