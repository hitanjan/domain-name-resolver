Plus product ratings for your website
eProductRating works with eDigitalSurvey, and displays on your website honest, straightforward customer ratings and comments of your products and the way you sell them. It's invaluable whether you trade on the web, on the high street or mail order - and can play a major role in your product promotion, brand building and customer loyalty.
Build on positive feedback, and immediately address negative
By gathering your customers' and prospects' opinions of their experience, you can identify positive issues and build on them - and negative issues before they impact your business. You'll also have access to site feedback, user segmentation, likes and dislikes, customer satisfaction, brand advocacy and competitive benchmarking.

Define, measure and identify the drivers of employee engagement by utilising our survey tool to create employee surveys and appraisals. We can compile and administer online surveys, to be delivered via email, intranet or print. Employee anonymity can be easily built in to encourage candid, honest feedback.
