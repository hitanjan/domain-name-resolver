Arts and EntertainmentArchaeology Field School: An Interdisciplinary ExchangeLandscape Architecture faculty member Tim Murtha and fifth-year student Chris Frey recently shared their expertise with the Department of Anthropology’s archaeological field school, which concluded this week at Foster Farmstead, a 19th-century historic site located on the grounds of the Arboretum at Penn State. Under the direction of Claire Milner, curator of the Matson Museum of Anthropology, twelve field school participants excavated in and around the farmhouse foundations and gained knowledge and hands-on experience that will prepare them for contract archaeology employment and graduate school in anthropology.
