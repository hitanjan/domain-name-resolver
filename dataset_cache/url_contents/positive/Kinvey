What our enterprise customers have to say about Kinvey
      











“We’re not concerned with scalability, quality or feature functionality. That just works. What we do is focus on our value add: the user experience in the mobile app.”
 



“With Kinvey on vCloud Air, we gained the benefits of a cost effective enterprise class mobile infrastructure with a fully managed service and can focus on supporting our customers.”




“Kinvey makes it simple with no IT overhead. Decoupling the user interface from the backend allows our developers to focus on product innovation instead of building or maintaining the backend platform.”
 







See why Schneider Electric chose Kinvey to power their mobile app platform.
