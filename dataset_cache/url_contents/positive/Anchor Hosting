Powered by the latest OpenStack Juno release, AnchorCloud is plumbed with 56Gbps InfiniBand — a networking technology commonly used in super-computing clusters. And high-performance, Ceph-backed SSD block storage means blazing-fast 15 second server deploys.
Full OpenStack, Swift and S3 APIs are exposed providing you with a flexible, simple and industry-standard cloud platform freeing you from worries about compatibility or vendor lock-in.
  

I trust the team at Anchor more than any other systems administrators I’ve ever worked with.
