Transcriptic is a web-based, on-demand remote life science research lab powered by advanced, custom robotic automation.

Using Transcriptic can be as easy as a few clicks in the secure web interface, or power users can write their own code to connect directly to our lab systems.




Get analytical results directly via web as soon as they're available.

Keep a close connection to your work.  As soon as data is available from lab execution, it's visible through the web interface and through the API.  Debug your reactions in real time, or write server applications that interactively run complex logic with a direct connection to a remote robotic laboratory.
