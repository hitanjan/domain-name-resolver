Helping  do amazing things

Case study: 

"Claranet’s technological expertise is plain to see – but it has been the overall service wrap that has impressed us the most. They have been agile and flexible at every turn, working with us to ensure that the solution is functioning the best way possible.” 







New MSP required quickly
Peugeot's previous Managed Services Provider (MSP) collapsed without warning. Peugeot relied on this MSP for the hosting of their microsites and suddenly found themselves in the position of having to find and migrate to a new hosting provider quickly, or risk losing up-time on these sites.
Managed hosting
Claranet proposed a flexible and scalable managed hosting solution that could satisfy the immediate hosting requirements, as well being able to evolve for future needs. Peugeot’s micro-sites were rapidly migrated to Claranet’s Managed Hosting environment.
Rapid migration
Vijay Mistry, Peugeot's Manager of Technical Services, concludes, “The main constraint with this project was time...That Claranet were able to deliver the solution within such a short space of time is an absolute credit to them.”
