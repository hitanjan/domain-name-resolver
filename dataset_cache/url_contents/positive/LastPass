One tool to rule them all. I use Windows at work and a Mac at home, LastPass works the same on both! My work uses the same bank as me, and with the multiple login feature I can easily choose which account to log into. I use LastPass Secure Notes for capturing information about equipment, licenses and expiration dates. The LastPass apps are invaluable. Gone are the days of separating work from personal. LastPass allows me to put all my eggs in one secure basket.
John P., 4-year user, 156 sites
