                Our newest recurring orders and delivery (AutoShip) feature offers the ability for
                customers to have products shipped on a recurring basis. The merchant can setup
                different payment schedules for the customer to choose from. Offer an incentive
                to purchase the AutoShip subscription products by using a discounted subscribe and
                save feature.

                Once the AutoShip subscription is active, the customer may make changes to the delivery
                frequency , shipping and billing addresses, as well as adding or changing payment
                information. The ability to edit the AutoShip program is still controlled by the
                merchant settings.
            

                After the AutoShip subscription plan is purchased, the customer may login to their
                account and view or change the plan. The merchant can control whether changes to
                a plan can be made and how far in advance of the next order coming due. The AutoShip
                delivery frequency can be customized by the merchant and changed by the customer.
                Additionally, the shipping and billing information can be updated. New payment methods
                can be added, updated, or removed and the information is stored securely and in
                compliance with VISA/PA-DSS security standards.
            

                A AutoShip management page is also available, so you can easily see the number of
                active subscriptions and when they will be expiring or ready for shipment. The configuration
                page allows you to send automated email for subscription activation, renewal, expiration,
                and changes.

                For more information, please see AutoShip / Recurring
                    Order Feature.
            









                        We recently finished a complete overhaul of our website, we selected AbleCommerce
                        and are now so glad we did!

                        Able's eCommerce is user friendly yet includes many features that streamline our
                        ordering and shipping process, and it's simple to make changes to our website as
                        needed.

                        The staff at AbleCommerce are very knowledgeable and were extreamely patient & helpful.

                        You don't have to spend $25k to get results. Don't let other salespersons steer
                        you the wrong way.

                        We made the decision to try the $1000 out of the box ready to go Able eCommerce
                        Store and we have been very happy with our decision.

                        Waste no more time, AbleCommerce is the only software out there that delivers!
