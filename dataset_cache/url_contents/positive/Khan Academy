            From kindergarten to calculus,
                  Khan Academy is here to help.
        






                Take control of your learning by working on the skills you choose at your own pace with free online courses.
            

                A free learning resource tailored for your child.
            

                A free learning resource
                      personalized for every student.
            

                Your child will get a personalized learning dashboard
                      that will guide them through each subject like a personal
                      coach while using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology
                      that identifies strengths and learning gaps while
                      suggesting skills to practice. Your child will also
                      receive fun rewards along the way like badges, energy
                      points, and avatars.
            

                Each student receives a custom learning dashboard that
                      lets them practice skills based on their level and your
                      assignments. Students can see how they’re doing and also
                      receive fun rewards along the way like badges and
                      points. Everyone works toward mastery at their own pace,
                      so no one gets left behind and no one gets bored.
            

















































































































































































































































































            Sharpen your skills with over 100,000 interactive exercises.
        

            Over 100,000 interactive exercises.
        

            You may have heard about our videos, but did you know
                  that Khan Academy has fun interactive math exercises
                  that cover skills ranging from counting to
                  calculus, grade by grade? Every exercise has step-by-step
                  hints, so your child can practice as much as needed.
        

            Created and peer-reviewed by a team of math
                  educators, our exercises include full coverage of US
                  Common Core and beyond, ranging from early math
                  through calculus. Every problem has interactive
                  hints, step-by-step solutions, and videos, so students
                  can get extra help when they need it. You can
                  access each student’s problem history to identify
                  learning gaps and provide additional guidance.
        




Review student progress in real time.
        

            You will be empowered with instant, in-depth feedback and
                  reports so you’ll know exactly where each student and your
                  class as a whole stand at any time throughout the year. You
                  can see how each student is doing on each skill and adjust
                  your lesson plans or assign additional practice
                  accordingly.
        




Stay up to date with your child’s progress.
        

            You’ll get quick email updates so you can see your
                  children’s progress as they learn, both when they’ve
                  mastered new skills and when they might be struggling.
                  At any time, you can see detailed reports and add
                  practice skills to your child’s dashboard.
