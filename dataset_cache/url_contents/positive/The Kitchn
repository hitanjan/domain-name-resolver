Your Guide to Loving Zucchini and Summer Squash All Season Long
Guides from The Kitchn






Pin it



	  It's easy to love zucchini and summer squash when they first appear on farmers market tables in vibrant stacks of green and yellow — trickier once we move deeper into the summer and zucchini seems to be stalking us at every turn. This summer, let's establish some new favorites early on and keep the party going as long as we possibly can.


	 Here's your guide to choosing, cooking, and loving zucchini and summer squash, from first blossom to the final garden harvest.

S'mores Pudding Icebox Cake

Open Slideshow



	       Second to frozen desserts, like ice cream and popsicles, s'mores (in any and all forms!) are a summertime staple. Graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows — no matter how you arrange those three simple ingredients, this dessert is a treat.


	    Whether you go for the standard toasted marshmallow and wedge of chocolate sandwiched between two graham crackers, prefer a more creative filling, or transform this sweet treat into something baked or frozen, you're on track for a delicious summer.

Everything You Need to Know About Growing Sage
Herb Gardening 101






Pin it



	    Mention the beautiful, hazy, pale green leaves of garden sage, and I immediately envision scenes in my grandmother's kitchen at Thanksgiving. Sage's pronounced pine-like aroma capitalizes on our most memory-evoking sense: smell. All I want at that moment is savory sage stuffing or sage-studded breakfast sausage to suddenly appear in my kitchen. I'd even settle for a sour cherry and sage bourbon smash.


	   The best part about growing sage is that you only need one of these incredibly easy-to-grow plants in your garden to enjoy its flavor throughout the year.

Drying Roses on the Kitchen Table
Kitchen Meditation






Pin it



	  It's early summer and the roses in my yard are in riotous, glorious bloom — almost surreal in their scent and color.  The other day the lusty, deep-pink ones were at their absolute peak; when I touched them the petals just fell away. So I brought a few handfuls into the house and left them to dry on my kitchen table, spread out on a plate.  No fussy prep here, just a scattering of petals and the gentle summertime air.  And time.

Why Summer Squash Was the Devil but Now It's Amazeballs
Strong Opinions






Pin it



	  Growing up, I wasn't the child that minded eating her veggies, but when it came to one in particular, I could sense its evil, slimy presence lurking — waiting to induce horrible gagging noises, a stuck-out tongue, and a ridiculous amount of whining.  Summer squash and zuchini, I'm looking at you!

The Midnight Scoop Is the Ferrari of Ice Cream Scoopers
Product Review









Pin it

































Product: Midnight Scoop
Price: $50
First Look: This is an ergonomic, heavy-duty ice cream scoop that's built to dig through hard ice cream and last for a lifetime.


	 I'm serious about my ice cream. However, there was a period of time in my early 20s when I was a lazy ice cream scooper. I would pull the container from the freezer and use my spoon as a spear to carve out pieces of hard ice cream. Not surprisingly, this resulted in a lot of bent spoons.


	 I eventually moved on to ice cream scoopers, and most recently was thrilled to take the Midnight Scoop, which is like the Ferrari of ice cream scoopers, for a test ride.

Garlic Confit Is the Magic Secret to Loving Any Vegetable
The Vegetable Butcher






Pin it



	Garlic confit is my secret ingredient, my special sauce, one of my all-time favorite tricks to give any vegetable a makeover. It's a play on an old technique (preserving meat in its own fat) and a venerable French dish (duck confit). You can use the same fancy term to cook and preserve garlic in essentially the same way. Except, here, olive oil is the fat of choice. The technique produces meltingly tender and sweet cloves, along with a by-product of fragrant and delicious oil. It's magic.

Here Is Why Your Zucchini Plant Produces So Much
Ingredient Intelligence






Pin it



	       If you've ever had a vegetable garden, particularly one that included a zucchini plant, you know how easy it is to get bogged down with a lot of zucchini — like pounds and pounds of zucchini — and how fast it can happen.


	 And if you are not familiar with this situation firsthand, just imagine a plant spitting out a constant stream of zucchini all summer long.
