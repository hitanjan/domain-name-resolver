Trusted by the grassroots


          Powering Democratic candidates, committees, parties,
          organizations, and c4s around the country.
        
















                  We love ActBlue! The million-strong Express community is a game-changer, not just for the DCCC, but for Democratic campaigns all across the country.
                






                    Brandon English, Deputy Executive Director for Digital Communications and Fundraising, DCCC
                  




                  With ActBlue’s tools, we’ve been able to create a powerful online donor community who can give with a single click. That means more resources for the dozens of women running for office that my Off the Sidelines PAC supports.
                






                    Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand
                  




                  ActBlue has changed the way people think about political fundraising, building a piece of infrastructure for the progressive movement that makes candidates beholden to small-dollar donors. We can always count on ActBlue to be innovating, keeping us on the cutting edge and raising the most money possible.
                






                    Becky Bond, President, CREDO SuperPAC
                  




                  The ActBlue advantage for state and local campaigns is clear: you get the same exact powerful fundraising tools as national candidates for free. The advantage for activists is even clearer: a level playing field on which to carry out the democratic process.
                






                    State Sen. Daniel Biss, Illinois
