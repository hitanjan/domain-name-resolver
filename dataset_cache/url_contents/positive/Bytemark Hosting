...I just wanted to say to thanks to the support chap who just helped me fix the boot problem on my rather critical database VM :) Damn fine service; I'd still be waiting on hold with some of the other companies I have to deal with...

Fair pricing

                Our prices for hosting are transparent — we quote only from list prices and don't offer "used car salesmen" discretionary discounts. Our staff have no sales targets and we pay no commission. We do respect long-term commitment and can offer a fair reduction for 2-3 year contracts.
