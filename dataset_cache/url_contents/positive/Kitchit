It's more than just a party.
            It's a pop-up that doesn't require you to cook anything.







No more fighting for hard-to-get reservations, swallowing big mark-ups on wine,
            or being hurried off over-booked tables.






The appeal for customers is clear–prices are affordable, comparison shopping is easy,
            and they come up with ideas for different types of dinner parties.






How about a dinner party for 8 or 10 at home, cooked by an accomplished chef?
            Kitchit has landed in New York.






You choose the price, type of food, etc., and someone shows up at your door
            to make a special meal. Could be a dinner for two, or a party with friends.






Through a startup called Kitchit, restaurant fanatics can now bring actual chefs
            into their home kitchens. No kidnapping required.
