Elastic Path Capabilities








CMS Optimized™
The best digital experiences are created using marketing platforms like Adobe® Experience Manager and OpenText® CEM. No ‘CMS-lite' functionality included with other commercially-available ecommerce suites even comes close. That's why Elastic Path was designed and engineered to work in tandem with digital experience software.





Omnichannel Commerce
Because all Elastic Path capabilities are supplied as flexible, high-performance APIs, they are ready to deliver consistent, real-time transactional data to every one of your customer channels — from the largest digital billboards and kiosks to the tiniest wearables like Google® Glass.








Advanced Bundling
When you choose Elastic Path, the industry's most powerful and exclusive bundling capabilities are also available to your business. Use them to streamline individual offerings into simple, compelling consumer bundles — and watch your sales skyrocket.





Live Authoring
Our Live Authoring components bring real-time transactional elements right into your content or experience management software. It's a simple formula: When marketers have access to ecommerce in their authoring environment, they create better digital experiences.








Personalized Merchandising
Elastic Path lets you extend personalization beyond content into the realm of product discovery, merchandising, and promotions — with a powerful rules-based engine that works with your digital experience software to serve up the right offer, to the right person, at the right time.





Product Information Management
Elastic Path goes beyond retail and empowers you to manage attributes and data that are specific to your business. From shirts and software to travel reservations, our adaptable PIM module delivers the flexibility you need to handle any combination of physical or digital products, services, subscriptions, and hybrid bundles.

Elastic Path Recognized for Third Consecutive Year by Gartner in Hype Cycle for Digital Marketing
In the category of Digital Commerce, which Gartner specifies as a “transformational” technology, Elastic Path was cited along with its partner Adobe.
“Digital commerce has the potential to transform a business. Digital marketers can support, and in some cases lead, this transformation by using digital marketing channels — Web, mobile and social — to engage customers, gather valuable data and drive sales transactions,” Gartner noted. “Digital commerce gives marketers the ability to use data and insights to personalize communication and customer engagement, thereby enhancing commerce experiences.” 
Commerce ExperiencesThe Gartner report states that Commerce Experiences adaptively frame the entire buying journey with specific intersections that vary by company, customer, and context. Elastic path is listed as a “Sample Vendor” in this category. “Brands and marketers already have commerce experiences, but they exist as a set of disconnected websites, applications and storefronts,” stated Gartner. “They should take a holistic approach to a digital commerce strategy by analyzing the customer decision journey and the various touchpoints across commerce experiences and opportunities to influence buying decisions through content, conversation, engagement, and analytics.” 
To this end, Gartner recommends that brands and marketers “should consider the unifying platforms needed to create a sustainable commerce experience.”
